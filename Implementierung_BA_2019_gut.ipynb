            "e study the effect of product market competition on the propensity to use corporate venture capital (CVC) as a part of an information technology (IT) ﬁrm’s innovation strategy. Using novel measures of product market competition based on product descriptions from ﬁrm 10-K statements and accounting for potential endogeneity, we investigate how product market competition between 1997 and 2007 relates to the magnitude of CVC spending. We ﬁrst ﬁnd that ﬁrms in competitive markets make higher research and development (R&D) and CVC investments. In addition, we ﬁnd that increasing product market competition leads to a shift away from internal R&D spending and into CVC. These movements are signiﬁcantly stronger for technology leaders, i.e., ﬁrms with deep patent stocks, in the IT industry. We also ﬁnd that CVC appears to be an effective way of exploiting external knowledge for technology leaders in the IT-producing industry, but not for technology slow starters. CVC investments lead to signiﬁcantly more patent applications for technology leaders but no appreciable difference for slow starters. Our results provide new insights for theories of innovation in competitive, dynamic markets, potentially as part of a portfolio that includes internal R&D as well as open innovation models.

            "Innovation is the lifeblood of technology companies. Developing new product and process innovations is a key contributor to a ﬁrm’s competitive position, especially for information technology (IT) producing ﬁrms (Kleis et al. 2012). IT-producing ﬁrms need to manage a more robust and ﬂexible pipeline of innovative activities, given the pace and complexity of technological change inherent to this industry (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2008, Wadhwa and Kotha 2006). Managing the supply side of innovation entails using multiple channels to access knowledge and learning since relying only on traditional research and development (R&D) may be associated with inertia, weaker incentives, and lower productivity (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005b, Fulghieri and Sevilir 2009). Therefore, managers need to look outside the ﬁrm for innovative ideas and insight. This is a variation of the classic make-or-buy decision but speciﬁcally associated with innovation.

Newer channels, such as crowdsourcing (Leimeister et al. 2009) and innovation tournaments (Boudreau et al. 2011), typically classiﬁed as open innovation (Chesbrough 2006), have also emerged since the mid-2000s. One such open innovation strategy is the focus of the research reported here, i.e., corporate venture capital (CVC). CVC is deﬁned as minority equity investments by established ﬁrms in start-ups, typically alongside traditional venture capitalists (VC) (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005a). The beneﬁts of CVC are primarily nonﬁnancial; a study commissioned by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2008 identiﬁed knowledge and learning objectives as the primary drivers of CVC investments (MacMillan et al. 2008). However, not all ﬁrms choose to invest in CVC: The importance of knowledge and learning is likely to be most relevant in technology-intensive industries where persistent innovation is a key determinant of success (Tambe et al. 2012).

            "a large proportion of CVC is found in the IT sector (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2006), as indicated in Figure 1, which illustrates that the IT industry accounts for the majority of CVC investments from 1997 to 2007, the period of our study. Beyond a need for innovation and knowledge, a critical factor that might also have a strong incremental inﬂuence on the observed intensity of CVC spending in the IT industry is product market competition. It is well established that IT-producing ﬁrms work in hyper-competitive markets (Lee et al. 2010) where there are strong winner-take-all dynamics (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2008). In the IT industry, fast moving technological progress and the resulting enhanced product market competition increases the ﬁrm’s incentives to develop innovative products and services. Therefore, as a ﬁrst response, these incentives lead to an increased focus on R&D investments. However, if traditional R&D is structurally limited in terms of how responsive it can be to a marketplace characterized by increasing product market competition, IT ﬁrms will need to consider alternative sources of innovation that provide ﬂexibility, knowledge, and competitive advantages in a shortened timeframe (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005b). Although traditional R&D is still key to success in the IT industry, increased competition will lead the ﬁrm to consider alternative forms of innovation spending. While this increased spending may show up in the form of alliances, acquisitions, and licensing agreements, we contend that CVC, as a channel, will be particularly attractive as a response to increased competition (Fulghieri and Sevilir 2009). Compared to other\n",

            "external innovation strategies, CVC provides a combination of ﬂexibility, technological knowledge, institutional familiarity, and strategic beneﬁts. Thus, in this paper, the ﬁrst research question we address is: Does product market competition faced by IT-producing ﬁrms lead to higher investments in CVC spending, all else equal? CVC, as a form of innovation spending, might provide the ﬁrm with access to knowledge and learning. Yet, are all ﬁrms equally likely to invest in CVC? Because CVC requires the ability to evaluate the entrepreneurial venture’s technology portfolio, assess its long-term ﬁnancial and strategic outlook, and make appropriate investment decisions, we argue that IT ﬁrms with deep technological stocks of knowledge are likely to be better positioned to use the CVC channel (Melville et al. 2007). In addition, these ﬁrms are more likely to respond strategically to increasing competition by realizing the limits of traditional R&D and the potential value of external innovation funding. Therefore, we posit that ﬁrms with technological leadership in patenting (i.e., deep patent stocks) are more likely to respond to increased competition through the CVC channel. Entrepreneurs also prefer to receive CVC funding from investor ﬁrms that have the technological capacities to understand and effectively use their technologies (Katila et al. 2008). Therefore, we hypothesize and show that technology leadership moderates the relationship between product market competition and CVC investments. Finally, we document the effectiveness of CVC strategies by considering the impact of CVC investments on ex-post innovation output.

Here again, we argue that the technological leadership in an investing ﬁrm is likely to moderate the beneﬁts from CVC on innovation output. Firms with technological leadership in innovation are more likely to ﬁrst, make better judgments in terms of their choice of which entrepreneurs to support, and second, to more effectively use the resulting knowledge. Therefore, our second research question asks: Do CVC investments lead to higher innovation output? If so, is the relationship moderated by the technology leadership of the investing ﬁrm? We address these research questions using data collected on all CVC investments made by U.S. ITproducing ﬁrms between 1997 and 2007. During this period, the level of CVC activity in the United States grew from roughly $800 million to over $2 billion.1 We collect CVC funding information from the VentureExpert data set, augmented with data from CompuStat and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) patent database. A speciﬁc challenge is to devise appropriate measures for product market competition. Standard measures in the literature based on Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC) or North American Industry Classiﬁcation Systems (NAICS) codes have inherent limitations as they are static and rigid (Tang 2006). The static nature of these measures is particularly limiting given the dynamic nature of market boundaries and competition in the fast moving IT industry, with rapid entry of new ﬁrms and exit of incumbents (Lee et al. 2010, McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2008). We use a novel measure of competition based on 10-K product descriptions. The textual network industry classiﬁcation (TNIC) was pioneered by Hoberg and Phillips (2010, 2016). TNIC classiﬁcations are based on the product market vocabulary in each ﬁrm’s 10-K and are updated every year. Firms using similar product market vocabularies are classiﬁed as being in the same industry, allowing for a more accurate measure of competition that captures the dynamic nature of the IT industry. Yearly updating of the entire TNIC product space ensures that ongoing product innovations are reﬂected in market boundaries and the identiﬁcation of each ﬁrm’s competitors. To our knowledge, this level of variability in competition cannot be matched using SIC-based measures. Our results verify that competition is linked to innovation spending in the IT-producing industry through a positive relationship between competition and traditional “internal ﬁrm” R&D.

A standard deviation increase in TNIC competition (in total similarity) is associated with a 76% increase in CVC intensity, corresponding to an increase from 1.7% to 3.1% in ﬁrm annual sales. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the shift toward CVC is accompanied by a shift away from internal R&D spending. These effects are stronger for technology leaders than for technology slow starters. Finally, we conﬁrm that CVC investments also improve ex-post innovation productivity, but only for technology leaders. We make three contributions to the information systems (IS) literature. First, much of the literature focuses on how technology investments in the ﬁrm generate greater innovation (Kleis et al. 2012, Nerkar and Paruchuri 2005, Tanriverdi 2005). However, less is known about the implications of alternative channels to access innovation, especially in the face of increasing competition. IT ﬁrms face a strategic imperative to continually innovate as their product markets become more competitive; in such settings, the traditional supply model of internal R&D appears increasingly limited in its ability to adequately respond (Schildt et al. 2005). Therefore, ﬁrms need to make choices in terms of their allocation of innovation spending between internal and external sources. In this paper, we examine product market competition, a systemic feature of the IT industry (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2008), as one such driver of this shift from internal to external innovation spending. Second, in evaluating the impact of product market competition on IT ﬁrms, we direct attention away from the traditional focus on the demand side (Joshi et al. 2010, Lee et al. 2010) to the supply side, i.e., the innovation-producing part of the ﬁrm. We argue that increased competition faced by the ﬁrm necessitates changes in strategy not only as to how it competes in the marketplace but also in the decisions it makes to overcome the shortcomings of traditional internal R&D spending. We thus broaden the focus of IS research on competition to include its effects on the use of external innovation. Finally, we show that R&D plays a more important contingent role in IT ﬁrms than previously acknowledged. Deep stocks of technological knowledge accumulated as a result of a robust R&D pipeline (Kleis et al. 2012), allow the ﬁrm to respond nimbly to increasing competition. The presence of an effective R&D division allows ﬁrms to productively tap valuable exploratory knowledge from their CVC investments, as CVC investment in startups contributes valuable knowledge well beyond ﬁnancial gains. Our work highlights the complementary role of R&D and open innovation models for accessing knowledge\n",

            "We start by brieﬂy discussing the close relationship between CVC and the IT industry, thereby establishing the incidence and legitimacy of CVC in the IT industry. We then argue that in the fast moving IT industry, higher levels of competition are associated with increased innovation spending in the form of R&D. We further propose that since internal R&D can be inertial and slow, ﬁrms facing competition will look outside the ﬁrm for technological insight and knowledge, thereby providing rationale for why CVC may be particularly appealing in the range of external options available to the ﬁrm. Finally, we hypothesize that CVC investments are likely to provide value for the investor ﬁrm in terms of innovation output (patents), but only for technological leaders. 2.1. Corporate Venture Capital and the IT Industry CVC is deﬁned as the establishment of a structurally distinct entity in an established ﬁrm dedicated to equity investing in young and promising enterprises (Gompers and Lerner 1998). CVC units retain several characteristics of traditional VCs. They perform due diligence when evaluating potential portfolio companies, they make deals that protect their assets and those of the entrepreneur, and they participate in syndication with VCs (Gompers and Lerner 2001). CVC units often complement private investors by providing industry-speciﬁc knowledge and information about complementary assets; they also frequently serve as a “beta” site for testing and certifying the new entrepreneur (Chesbrough 2006, De Clercq et al. 2006). However, CVC units also differ from traditional VC ﬁrms in several critical aspects. First, unlike VCs, CVC units use internal funds and do not raise capital from institutional investors (Chesbrough 2006). Second, unlike VC ﬁrms, ﬁnancial returns are not the primary motive behind CVC investments (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2006). CVC ﬁrms pursue strategic objectives, i.e., early exposure to innovative technologies that might disrupt business models, access to new markets and businesses (Schildt et al. 2005), identiﬁcation of prospective acquisition targets (Benson and Ziedonis 2009), and potential means to dissuade competitors from acquiring a portfolio company (Fulghieri and Sevilir 2009). Third, CVC ﬁrms rarely take board positions or lead syndication efforts, preferring to invest alongside VCs (De Clercq et al. 2006). The literature also notes that CVC units use different compensation schemes to avoid conﬂicts of interest (Block and Ornati 1988), suggesting again that ﬁnancial incentives, in the form of entrepreneurial exits, may not dominate CVC investments; instead,\n",

            "access to knowledge, intelligence, and innovative insight are of greater importance to investing ﬁrms (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005b). The emergence of the CVC model in the early 1990s was sparked by, and intimately associated with, the rise of the IT industry (Gaba and Meyer 2008). Disappointing returns associated with traditional R&D in the late 1980s and rapid technological shifts in computing acted as catalysts for the interest in CVC (Mowery 1999). Several factors linked to the IT industry inﬂuenced the growth of CVC as an investment strategy. First, traditional VC activity was starting to achieve celebrity status due to successes in identifying early stage IT ﬁrms, and rapidly accelerating the growth of these ﬁrms into established brand names (Gompers and Lerner 2001). Having grown through the VC model, ﬁrms such as eBay, Apple, and Intel have thus pioneered their own CVC activities (Gaba and Meyer 2008). Second, over 70% of VC disbursements ﬂowed to IT industry entrepreneurs, fueled in part by the Internet, telecom, and online commerce (Gompers and Lerner 2001). In addition, the relatively short clock speed observed in IT-producing ﬁrms allowed VCs to quickly recoup their investments, relative to slower sectors such as biotechnology (Mendelson and Pillai 1999). These successes further propelled the adoption of CVC programs, especially among IT-producing ﬁrms (Gaba and Meyer 2008). Third, and signiﬁcantly, the VC model showed how relatively small investments in speciﬁc new ventures could provide very high returns; Kortum and Lerner (2000) estimated that a dollar invested in CVC generated four times as much innovation as equivalent investments in traditional R&D. Even modest CVC spending relative to R&D spending could have relatively high payoffs. Not surprisingly, CVC disbursements as a share of total VC spending grew from 5.5% in 1995 to over 14% in 2000, with two-thirds of overall funding emerging from ITproducing ﬁrms.2 Leading IT ﬁrms, such as Intel, have helped legitimize CVC as an acceptable channel for innovation spending: “Intel and other electronic ﬁrms typically view venture capital investing as one of the three pillars of innovation, along with internal R&D and acquisitions” (Roberts 2006, p. 54). Despite these accolades, the CVC model is not without risk. A central concern is that the VC model is not easily deployed in the corporate context (Gaba and Meyer 2008, Gompers and Lerner 2001). VC ﬁrms rely heavily on tacit knowledge and personal networks for guidance and valuation; these are challenging to emulate by corporate CVC units. In addition, CVC units must offer compensation schemes that attract top talent while minimizing friction between\n",

            "departmental heads (R&D managers in particular) and in-house CVC heads (Block and Ornati 1988, Edelson 2001). Unlike traditional VC heads, CVC heads must also balance parent-ﬁrm preferences against their own valuations of entrepreneurs; this might limit their overall effectiveness (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005b, Gaba and Meyer 2008). As a result, corporate venturing programs have been referred to as cyclical, unstable, naïve, and prone to failure (Edelson 2001, Gaba and Meyer 2008). The potential drawbacks of CVC coupled with the potential beneﬁt of access to innovative knowledge that the strategy offers (Chesbrough 2006, Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005b, Wadhwa and Kotha 2006), beg the question: When would IT-producing ﬁrms choose to pursue CVC as a strategy to access external knowledge? We argue that one salient aspect of the IT industry that may systematically “tip” ﬁrms into using the CVC model is the presence of competition arising from volatility in product market boundaries and the fast pace of innovation. Before hypothesizing about the relationship between competition and CVC, we ﬁrst discuss the broader question of the effects of competition on ﬁrm-level innovation spending. Product Market Competition and Innovation Spending At its core, CVC represents innovation spending on the part of the ﬁrm. Therefore, we must ﬁrst describe a baseline relationship between competition and innovation spending in the IT industry. The literature shows that the relationship between competition and innovation spending is rather ambiguous. On one hand, theories of industrial organization argue that innovative output should decline with competition (Dixit and Stiglitz 1977), since competition reduces any post-innovative rents earned by the innovator (Grossman and Helpman 1991). This Schumpeterian viewpoint argues that monopoly power is a precondition for innovation (Schumpeter 1942). Monopoly ﬁrms face less market uncertainty, can secure postinnovation rents, can preempt entry, face fewer ﬁnancial constraints (Dasgupta and Stiglitz 1980, Gilbert and Newbery 1982), and therefore are more likely to innovate. An alternative view is that competition tends to increase innovation (Arrow 1962, Lee and Wilde 1980); this is referred to as the “escape competition” hypothesis (Aghion et al. 2005). Innovation offers the possibility of creating new products to replace incumbents, thereby allowing the innovator to “escape” competition (Arrow 1962). Alternatively, ﬁrm managers might seek private beneﬁts from innovation to keep their jobs (Hart 1983). For example, managers might innovate to keep costs down as revenues are reduced through competition; this leads to a positive relationship 2.2.\n",
            "\n",
            "between competition and innovation. Finally, Aghion et al. (2005) argue that competition may increase innovation spending because it reduces the ﬁrm’s preinnovation rents more than its post-innovation rents. The empirical literature on the effect of competition on innovation spending is ambiguous. Nickell (1996) and Blundell et al. (1999) show a positive association between competition and innovation spending, while Schumpeter (1942) and Tang (2006) report the opposite. Aghion et al. (2005) ﬁnd an inverted U-shaped relationship. Theoretical models have suggested that the relationship between competition and innovation is likely nuanced and is contingent on factors such as the form of innovation (product versus process, for instance) (Bonanno and Haworth 1998), the presence of variable R&D cost (Lee and Wilde 1980), “neck-toneck” industry structure (Nelson and Winter 2009), and intellectual property (IP) appropriability in the industry (Levin et al. 1985). In effect, the relationship between competition and innovation depends on salient features of the industry at hand. In the IT industry, relevant to our study, we identify critical factors that help establish the likely relationship between competition and innovation spending. First, the industry is characterized by volatility in market boundaries as market positions frequently change (Lee et al. 2010). This volatility is driven by high clock speed (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2008, Mendelson and Pillai 1999). Thus, incumbent market leaders cannot “coast” on older or existing technologies for long. Second, competition in the IT industry is aggressive and comes in the form of new products and technologies that might supplant incumbents (Kleis et al. 2012, Sambamurthy et al. 2003). In such markets, innovation and new product development are likely to be more important than price competition or branding (Wadhwa and Kotha 2006). Therefore, managing the supply side of innovation is critical for the longterm success of the ﬁrm. Because market leadership changes frequently due to rapid developments in new products and technologies, and innovation is needed to develop new products and services, the IT industry is likely to be characterized by the “escape competition” effect (Aghion et al. 2005, Arrow 1962, Lee and Wilde 1980). Therefore, as a baseline, we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1 (H1). Higher levels of competition in a product market will be associated with an increase in R&D investments, within the IT industry. Because the data-generating process underlying product market competition in the IT industry is dynamic, and competitive boundaries change frequently, this hypothesis can only be fully tested using a dynamic industry classiﬁcation. Static deﬁnitions may not fully capture the nature or effect of competition.\n",

            "Given appropriate dynamic measures of competition, we test this hypothesis using absolute R&D spending (in dollars) (Kleis et al. 2012) scaled by ﬁrm sales. Product Market Competition and CVC Spending Although H1 posits that competition is positively associated with R&D spending, internal R&D is limited in its ability to keep up with the required speed and range of innovation needed in competitive product markets. Internal R&D tends to be inertial; managers ﬁnd it hard to adapt to new market conditions, and are often trapped by legacy success (competency traps) (Chesbrough 2006). In addition, existing R&D is focused on existing customers, and extending the services of existing technological platforms and products (i.e., “own and protect” approach) rather than truly path-breaking innovations (Diener and Piller 2010). Thus, R&D is viewed as less efﬁcient than external innovation, especially in fast moving industries (Aghion et al. 2005). When small capital investments can produce potentially disruptive technologies (disruptive here referring to the introduction of new technologies that create new structure and competitive dynamics in the industry; Mendelson 2000), the productivity differences between internal R&D and external innovation spending become even larger (Aghion et al. 2005). Because the IT-producing industry is characterized by relatively low capital requirements (the stereotypical “IT entrepreneur in a garage”) and a high incidence of disruptors (Walsh et al. 2002), particularly in the turbulent software and service sectors (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2008), the incentive to augment traditional R&D is likely to be keenly felt. This incentive should be increasing in product market competition for two reasons. First, increasing competition is typically associated with lower barriers to entry. As a result, the capital requirements needed to threaten or challenge incumbents should be low, allowing greater chances of market loss, and even exit. Second, the incidence of game-changing technological players emerging in the marketplace should increase with higher competition; the odds of successful disruption of the existing market structure for the enterprising entrepreneurial ﬁrm or aggressive incumbent competitor are higher. Successful technological aggressor ﬁrms seek the possibility of escaping competition via innovation and new technologies, especially in the dynamic IT context (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2008, Mendelson and Pillai 1999). The combination of low capital and quicker disruption, coming from increasing competition, will incentivize ﬁrms to move some innovation spending outside the ﬁrm (Aghion et al. 2005). Even though the above arguments for external innovation are couched in the language of incentives 2.3.\n",
            "\n",
            "and efﬁciency, the true value of external innovation comes from providing knowledge to the investor ﬁrm, a critical source of competitive advantage in technology-based industries (Grant 1996). It has been acknowledged that all forms of external innovation spending, such as licensing, alliances, and acquisitions, as well as CVC, lead to knowledge gains for the ﬁrm (Ahuja and Katila 2001, Arora 1996, Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005b, Iansiti 2000, Rothaermel 2001). However, if access to knowledge is the key to driving innovation spending outside the ﬁrm, why might CVC be preferred by ﬁrms, even when controlling for alternative external innovation pathways? We propose that CVC may be of particular importance as a knowledge source in the presence of competition for two reasons. First, CVC is especially useful in providing access to explorative knowledge (Schildt et al. 2005) associated with “search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, ﬂexibility, discovery and innovation” (March 1991, p. 71). By contrast, licensing, alliances, and acquisitions are strongly associated with exploitative learning, characterized by “reﬁnement, choice, production, efﬁciency, selection, and implementation” (March 1991, p. 71). Increasing product market competition requires that ﬁrms access knowledge that helps them escape competition; exploratory learning is more useful in terms of providing break-through technological options to the ﬁrm to escape competition (Schildt et al. 2005), thereby making CVC more attractive. Second, unlike acquisitions and alliances, which are rooted in present R&D capabilities of the ﬁrm (Iansiti 2000), CVC allows the investor ﬁrm to retain ﬂexibility in the relationship at a relatively low cost and with no commitment beyond the modest ﬁnancial one in the short term. In competitive markets, the ability to retain ﬂexibility and reversibility in the relationship with the external innovation ﬁrm is particularly attractive (Sahaym et al. 2010, Van de Vrande et al. 2006). Schildt et al. (2005) reinforce this relationship, noting that among options available to investor ﬁrms, CVC is the most ﬂexible, and hence more attractive as competition increases. Furthermore, given the close relationship between CVC and the IT industry (Gaba and Meyer 2008), using CVC to gain external knowledge and innovation is familiar to IT ﬁrms’ managers, through narratives from peers. Mechanisms such as board observation rights, shared personnel, technology review processes, and ofﬁcial liaison roles, allow CVC investors to gain knowledge from their portfolio ﬁrms. For example, Agilent Technologies’ CVC unit worked closely with their portfolio company to share information about technologies, qualify investment opportunities, and connect the portfolio company to its own initiatives (Dushnitsky and Lenox\n",

Intel’s investments in Berkeley Networks provided similar value: “As Intel performed its due diligence on its investment, it began to see the outlines of a possible strategy shift culminating in the Intel Internet Exchange Architecture, launched in 1999. The investment in Berkeley Networks allowed Intel to identify a promising opportunity more quickly than it might have otherwise” (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005b, p. 618). Chesbrough (2002) writes about how Microsoft earmarked $1 billion to invest in startups that could help advance its new .Net architecture. Through these investments, Microsoft hoped not only to get the ﬁrms to exploit its new architecture but also to identify opportunities that could be incorporated into the architecture for new products and services, thereby gaining over rivals Sun Microsystems and IBM. Even during the early years of CVC, Lerner (2013) discusses how Analog Devices created a CVC program to invest in new technology ﬁrms with the goal of gathering strategic information at relatively low cost. All of these knowledge-oriented beneﬁts from CVC are likely to be even more attractive to the investor ﬁrm during times of increased competition. Clearly, if knowledge is the key strategic beneﬁt behind CVC, such investments likely entail knowledge transfer in both directions (to and from the entrepreneur ﬁrm to the CVC investor). As a result, CVC investment can be seen as a trade-off between the value of knowledge transfer gained (incentive for more CVC) and the cost of leaking proprietary knowledge to other ﬁrms (disincentive for more CVC). Firms in less competitive product markets, where barriers to entry are high and need to be maintained, likely see more of the disincentives of leakage, as this can directly weaken their current barriers to entry. By contrast, ﬁrms in competitive industries, who lack barriers to entry, likely see more of the incentives to gaining knowledge from CVC. This trade-off reinforces the notion that as competition increases, the intensity of CVC should also increase. We thus propose: Hypothesis 2 (H2). Higher levels of competition in a product market will be associated with an increase in CVC investments, within the IT industry. Analogous to our testing of H1, we examine whether dynamically measured competition can explain CVC dollars spent scaled by ﬁrm sales. While we have argued that product market competition will lead to greater CVC investments, total innovation spending is typically limited or constrained in IT ﬁrms (Kleis et al. 2012). Firms are required to strategically allocate their innovation spending between traditional R&D and external channels such as CVC. Therefore, the arguments for CVC, predicated on the value of explorative knowledge and ﬂexibility, can be extended to further predict that IT\n",

            "ﬁrms will explicitly shift funds from internal R&D to CVC as a response to competition. This stronger prediction, based on theoretical work by Fulghieri and Sevilir (2009), comes from two effects. First, the incentive effect predicts that an external entrepreneur has, and retains, stronger incentives to innovate compared to internal R&D, consistent with Aghion and Tirole (1994) and Chesbrough (2006). This is in contrast to acquisitions (where external innovation is internalized) and alliances (where internal R&D sets the tone for the alliance; Lane and Lubatkin 1998). The armslength nature of CVC helps maintain strong incentives for the portfolio ﬁrm (Schildt et al. 2005). The second effect that is distinctive to CVC and that enhances its value in competitive environments is the strategic effect (Fulghieri and Sevilir 2009), which posits that CVC investments are likely to generate information about the entrepreneur as a potential acquisition target (Benson and Ziedonis 2009). In addition, the CVC investment can thus prevent other ﬁrms from funding or acquiring the entrepreneur, making it unlikely that any knowledge gains from the relationship can freely enter the market and be used by competitors. Internal R&D does not provide any such beneﬁts because of its weak incentives; the same is true for licensing arrangements or alliances, which are alternative channels for external innovation, since they may not preclude competitors from accessing the same know-how (Sahaym et al. 2010). Furthermore, acquisitions may provide the focal ﬁrm with exploitative knowledge assets but signiﬁcantly reduce any ﬂexibility (Schildt et al. 2005), while also reducing the incentives of the external innovator (Aghion and Tirole 1994).3 Thus, as competition increases, ﬁrms are likely to re-allocate their innovation spending from R&D into CVC, leading to the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 3 (H3). Higher levels of competition in a product market will be associated with an increase in CVC investments in the IT industry, relative to internal R&D. To test this hypothesis, we examine the effect of competition on the ratio of CVC spending to total\n",

            "An indirect validation of these arguments is provided by Benson and Ziedonis (2010) who ask: Do CVC investors acquire their portfolio ﬁrms and if so, do they gain greater value than when they acquire other ﬁrms? The results show that most CVC investors do not buy portfolio ﬁrms and that such acquisitions are valuedestroying, relative to other acquisitions. If a CVC investment, which is ﬁnancially much smaller than an acquisition or equivalent investments in R&D, can provide knowledge and insight to the investor, as has been shown by Dushnitsky and Lenox (2005b), then there is no need to acquire the portfolio ﬁrm. Furthermore, if the investor does purchase the ﬁrm, Benson and Ziedonis (2010) argue that this is indicative of “managerial overconﬁdence or agency problems at the CVC program level” (p. 497), leading to value destruction. However, the knowledge-based beneﬁts from CVC are still evident in the literature (Schildt et al. 2005).\n",

            "CVC plus R&D spending (the shift toward CVC relative to R&D). The Moderating Role of Technological Leadership Hypotheses H2 and H3 argue for the direct effect of competition on CVC, but do not account for the effects of heterogeneity on the R&D capabilities of the investor ﬁrm. We are primarily interested in the ﬁrm’s R&D technological leadership, i.e., the extent to which the ﬁrm is a leader in terms of its abilities to develop, maintain, and enhance technological and product innovation in the ﬁrm’s R&D function (Fichman 2004, Aghion et al. 2005). Prior literature shows that technology leaders, with deep technological expertise, tend to have better processes and personnel to absorb new technologies (Fichman 2004). By virtue of these capabilities, they are more likely to be “mindful” of the beneﬁts of the various innovation options available to them, rather than simply exhibiting herding behavior (Swanson and Ramiller 2004). In the alliances and licensing literature as well, knowledge gains for ﬁrms from such activities are driven by the extent to which participating ﬁrms have existing deep knowledge stocks (Lane and Lubatkin 1998, Malhotra et al. 2005, Vasudeva and Anand 2011). It follows, then, that in the CVC channel, technological leader ﬁrms (with signiﬁcant patent portfolios) are likely to have better “intuition” about the value of speciﬁc investments and their potential role in allowing the ﬁrm to escape competition. This stems from raw entrepreneurial quality as well as synergies between the entrepreneurial ﬁrm and the investor (Chesbrough 2002, Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005b). The investor’s technological leadership is even more relevant in the case of explorative learning (Schildt et al. 2005), which is more uncertain; Cohen and Levinthal (1990) argue that having related knowledge facilitates the identiﬁcation, interpretation, and assimilation of related knowledge. If H2 and H3 hold, and if explorative knowledge is relevant to generating the positive link between CVC spending and the level of competition, these effects should hold especially for technology leaders facing competition. Technology leaders will be better at identifying and preemptively acting to combat competitive threats relative to ﬁrms that do not have deep capabilities. Therefore: Hypothesis 4 (H4). The relationship between product market competition and CVC investments is greater for ﬁrms that have deep technological expertise, namely technology leaders in their product markets. We measure technology leadership using the ﬁrm’s deeply lagged patent stocks, thereby avoiding endogeneity concerns while ensuring that leaders have a mature ability to turn innovation into patents. 2.4.\n",

            "The previous hypotheses were based on the logic that the focal ﬁrm’s status as a technology leader, combined with potential access to knowledge, are central to the relationship between competition and CVC investment. A straightforward implication is that the proposed knowledge transfer from CVC should directly generate higher ex-post innovation output (i.e., in patents), and that technology leaders should beneﬁt most from these transfers (Cockburn and Henderson 1998, Katila et al. 2008). By virtue of their technological capabilities and ability to convert research activity into patents and thereafter products or services, technological leaders are more likely to convert knowledge gained from CVC into innovation output. While all ﬁrms may perceive competitive threats, the corresponding ability to appropriate returns from “outside” likely resides only with leaders (Chesbrough 2006). Therefore: Hypothesis 5 (H5). CVC investments have a positive impact on innovation output in the IT industry, but only for technology leaders.\n",

We included other years without any CVC investment for each ﬁrm after the ﬁrst year in which it was observed to invest in CVC. Periods before this ﬁrst observed CVC investment were omitted as it is unclear whether the ﬁrm had any interest in CVC in these periods.6 Our ﬁnal sample thus comprises 1,185 ﬁrm-year observations for 145 ﬁrms between 1997 and 2007 and forms our primary database. We add relevant information from other sources to this database. For each ﬁrm-year observation in our baseline database, we require information on the product market competition faced by the given ﬁrm in that year. Therefore, we use TNIC data from Hoberg and Phillips (2010, 2016), described in §3.2. Additional ﬁnancial and organizational data on investor ﬁrms was taken from Compustat. We also used the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database to obtain monthly stock returns for investor ﬁrms. Finally, we collect patent data for each ﬁrm in each year from the NBER patent citation database (Hall et al. 2001) to capture the level of technological expertise of the ﬁrm in a given year. Consistent with the literature, we used application year rather than grant year for patent activity because the application date is closer to the date of the actual innovative activity. This combined database provides us with an unbalanced panel of ﬁrm-year CVC investments, and describes the extent to which ﬁrms allocate innovation dollars to CVC in a given year. We discuss the individual variables in detail in §3.2. 3.2. Variable Deﬁnitions Product market competition, the primary independent variable in our analysis, is measured using the TNIC data set provided by Hoberg and Phillips (henceforth “HP”) (Hoberg and Phillips 2010, 2016). While a detailed description of the data set is provided in the online appendix (available as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/isre.2016.0620), we brieﬂy outline the TNIC variables here. The TNICbased competition variables are based on the text of product descriptions of ﬁrm 10-K ﬁling statements.

The intuition is that ﬁrms that use highly similar product market vocabularies operate in the same product markets and are rivals. Once a set of rival ﬁrms is identiﬁed for each focal ﬁrm using computational linguistics, dynamic measures of product market competition can then be computed because the set of rivals is recalculated in each year, as 10-Ks are re-ﬁled annually. The database is comprehensive on publicly-traded ﬁrms, as HP Web crawl and parse all business descriptions from the full set of 10-K ﬁlings on the SEC Edgar database. Using the textual cosine similarity method on the vector of product market nouns found in ﬁrms’ business descriptions, HP then computes a matrix of ﬁrm-pair similarities, which lie in the range 0 1 for every possible pairing of ﬁrms. This procedure is repeated every year, thereby allowing these similarity metrics to vary over time for the same focal ﬁrm (the metrics are deﬁned in more detail in the online appendix). The annual similarity matrix is analogous to a network identifying product market relatedness. A given ﬁrm A’s industry is composed of ﬁrms whose product similarity to ﬁrm A exceeds a threshold.7 The threshold is chosen such that the TNIC industry granularity matches that of three-digit SIC codes.8 The central advantage that the TNIC provides in our setting is that TNIC updates each focal ﬁrm’s competitive industry every year as every ﬁrm’s 10-K product description changes. TNIC industries also relax the transitivity property of SIC codes, allowing us to improve power and to measure competition strictly relative to each given ﬁrm, rather than in coarse SIC code groups. TNIC data underscores how much ﬁrm competitive environments change: Roughly 35% of TNIC rivals in a given year t are no longer rivals one year later. This is due to ongoing innovation and product changes by IT ﬁrms seeking product differentiation. TNIC thus allows for a more updated and ﬁne-grained deﬁnition of competition that is useful given the high level of competition\n",

Additionally, given the unbalanced nature of the panel, many ﬁrms enter and exit the panel during the period of analysis. Finally, some observations were dropped due to missing data.

We use the COMPUSTAT segment tapes to identify how many segments each ﬁrm has. We now drop ﬁrms that have more than one segment. Our results do not qualitatively change even when we drop diversiﬁed ﬁrms in our sample. This suggests that the effect of diversiﬁed ﬁrms is small in our sample.\n",

            "observed in the IT-producing industries (Tanriverdi and Lee 2008). Based on TNIC industry classiﬁcations, we consider three product market competition measures, i.e., the CVC ﬁrm’s total similarity across its TNIC industry, the total number of its TNIC rival ﬁrms, and the Lerner Index (LI) in a TNIC industry.9 The total similarity of ﬁrm A is deﬁned as the sum of product market pairwise cosine similarities relative to ﬁrm A across ﬁrms in A’s TNIC industry. Higher total similarity implies more competition in the ﬁrm’s TNIC industry. In addition, we compute the total number of ﬁrms operating in the focal ﬁrm’s TNIC per year. A larger number of ﬁrms indicates higher product market competition.10 We believe that the TNIC total similarity and ﬁrm count competition measures are more informative in explaining CVC investments because typical measures of industry structure, such as the LI and Herﬁndahl–Hirschman (HHI) indices, are based on past or current performance, whereas the two TNIC variables measure present and forwardlooking competition (Hoberg and Phillips 2016). In particular, the new measures focus on the existence and proximity of ﬁrms in a given ﬁrm’s market rather than the distribution of ﬁrm sales or income levels (which often do not reﬂect the fact that the IT ﬁrms’ potential is forward looking). Nevertheless, we include the industry LI for comparison with prior work (Aghion et al. 2005). We calculate the industry LI based on the price cost margin in the ﬁrm’s TNIC as follows: 1 N Proﬁti LI = 1 − N i=1 Salesi Higher industry LI indicates more competition. Because each focal ﬁrm has a unique industry (TNIC membership does not require transitivity), these industry-level variables are not the same for all ﬁrms in a focal ﬁrm’s industry. This ability to avoid restrictive transitivity requirements does not apply to traditional industry classiﬁcations such as SIC and NAICS as all ﬁrms in the same industry (e.g., SIC 730) have the same competition measures. To construct our key dependent variables for R&D and CVC spending, we compute them as actual dollars spent scaled by the ﬁrm’s sales, to reﬂect scale.\n",

We also include a control for ﬁrm-level CVC experience, measured as the number of years between the ﬁrst observed CVC investment by that ﬁrm in VentureXpert and the current year. We use CompuStat to obtain the following ﬁrmspeciﬁc ﬁnancial variables, i.e., ﬁrm size, free cash ﬂow, and sales growth, consistent with prior work (Benson and Ziedonis 2009, Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005a). We control for the size of corporate CVC investors because larger ﬁrms are likely to have more resources to devote to innovation activities. Financial slack, captured by free cash ﬂow, is valuable for all forms of investments, but may be particularly important for innovation investments (Blundell et al. 1999). External ﬁnancing is believed to be more costly than internal ﬁnancing in an imperfect capital market for information reasons (Myers and Majluf 1984). External ﬁnancing may also be riskier because competitors may acquire valuable information for innovation projects when a ﬁrm wants to ﬁnance externally (Blundell et al. 1999).

Portfolio Management Competition (PMC) represents the TNIC-based competition level for each ﬁrm, and X includes vectors of ﬁrm-speciﬁc characteristics that could affect the ﬁrm’s innovation investments. Note that we include the same set of control variables in both CVC and R&D equations, with the exception of CVC experience included only in the equation for CVC intensity. Firm- and year-ﬁxed effects are represented by i and t , respectively. We lag all independent variables by one year in the analysis to better reﬂect a ﬁrm’s search process for innovation, and consistent with the literature (Blundell et al. 1999). We ﬁrst estimate Equation (1) using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with robust standard errors clustered by ﬁrm and a ﬁrm ﬁxed-effects (FE) model to account for time-invariant ﬁrm characteristics. However, omitted variable bias and reverse causality concerns are not addressed in these models. An example of such an omitted variable could be the emergence of a signiﬁcant technological opportunity, such as the ratiﬁcation of an important protocol or a breakthrough in a related technological sector (Cohen 2010). In addition, although we argue that competition may lead to larger CVC (or R&D), the reverse relationship is also possible: Firms investing in CVC (or R&D) may be successful in differentiating their products from their rivals, thereby reducing competition (Sutton 1991). Without addressing these concerns, OLS and FE estimations are potentially biased. We account for endogeneity using the generalized method of moments (GMM)-based dynamic panel data estimator (Arellano and Bond 1991, Blundell and Bond 1998). Although the best-case solution to the endogeneity of competition would be to identify an appropriate instrument, ﬁnding such instruments that generate exogenous variation in competition (since competition is by deﬁnition an industry-level construct) is challenging. Hence, we use the construction of internal instruments in the data as provided\n",

Also, because some independent variables such as ﬁrm size and patent stock are not strictly exogenous, such models also allow us to construct instruments for these variables as well. Therefore, the main analysis we present in the paper is based on the Blundell and Bond (1998) “System” GMM estimation, which uses lagged levels and differences of independent variables as internal instruments. Because average competition is relatively persistent in our sample, it is advisable to use system GMM with differences in variables as additional moments rather than lagged levels of the competition variables in the differences GMM speciﬁcation11 (Bobba and Coviello 2007). We therefore use this approach in estimating Equation (1). Because too many instruments can lead to a ﬁnite sample bias and high pass rates of speciﬁcation tests such as the Hansen J-test, we follow Roodman (2009) and use only certain lags for the system GMM speciﬁcations. We checked the validity of the moment conditions required by system GMM using the Hansen test, which does not reject the assumption that our instruments are exogenous (Blundell and Bond 1998, Roodman 2009). H5 pertains to the effect of CVC investments on ex-post innovation output for the ﬁrm. We adopt the Poisson speciﬁcation with ﬁrm effects for this test. We consider the following: E Iit xit\n",

One concern about this estimator is that it relies on an assumption of strictly exogenous independent variables, which may be violated since some variables such as patent stock (technology leadership) are potentially predetermined. Therefore, we also report analysis using the pre-sample mean estimator approach of Blundell et al. (1999) as a robustness check (Galasso and Simcoe 2011). This estimator uses the pre-sample information on innovation available to sample ﬁrms to identify the initial advantages enjoyed by different ﬁrms in terms of innovation productivity and substitutes the pre-sample information for the unobservable FE. We use patent stock in the pre-sample period (1995) to capture this unobservable ﬁrm-speciﬁc effect. We thus use a longer history of innovations to generate a cleaner estimation of ﬁrm-speciﬁc effects.\n",

From Table 2, the mean annual CVC investment for the CVC sample across all years is $12.8 million. Considering only years with non-zero CVC spending increases the mean annual CVC spending to $30.5 million. For reference, the mean R&D expenditure in the sample is $439.8 million. CVC investment amounts in the sample exhibit a wide variation in magnitude from 0 to $947.1 million over time.

In each set of results, the three TNIC-based competition variables are introduced in the analysis in turn, i.e., the total similarity variable for the ﬁrm, the number of ﬁrms, and the LI. Columns (1)–(3) of the OLS results indicate that ﬁrms in competitive markets are likely to increase the amount of their R&D investments. All three coefﬁcients pertaining to competition are significant and positive. The Blundell and Bond “System” GMM for Equation (1) are shown in columns (7)–(9) of Table 3 (Blundell and Bond 1998). Across the full set of results, we observe statistically weak support for H1, which posits a positive association between competition and R&D investments. When we estimate ﬁrm FE models shown in columns (4)–(6), we see qualitatively similar results. We next turn to the effect of competition on CVC investments. Table 4, Panel A, presents regressions with the same set of speciﬁcations as in Table 3. The dependent variable is CVC intensity, i.e., annual CVC investments divided by sales. The results of the regressions explaining CVC investments are statistically and economically stronger than those for R&D investments in Table 3. The results from the OLS and ﬁrm FE regressions, shown in columns (1)–(6), show signiﬁcant support for the association between product market competition and CVC investments.

That is, if another researcher measures total similarity using another metric such as geographic distance, for example, the measures of total similarity they would obtain are not comparable to those using TNICs. As a result, we caution readers against inferring too much from the raw magnitudes in isolation. However, we do believe that the magnitudes are interpretable once the standard deviation is reported.

Hypothesis H3 argues that increased competition is likely to make CVC investments more attractive than internal R&D, given the beneﬁts of ﬂexibility (Schildt et al. 2005). Table 4, Panel B, provides estimates where the dependent variable is the log ratio of CVC spending to the total spending on innovation (CVC + R&D). The results show a positive association between product market similarity and the ratio of CVC to CVC + R&D spending, as hypothesized. The results from the OLS and the FE models are also qualitatively similar. Overall, the results lend support to H3, i.e., ﬁrms do appear to shift innovative spending to CVC as a result of competition. We note that ﬁrm-speciﬁc R&D spending is extremely high compared to the average CVC spending; therefore, it would be erroneous to interpret this result as suggesting that CVC is a substitute for internal R&D. Rather, we believe that as IT-producing ﬁrms experience increased competition in their product markets, they are likely to ﬁnd value in small but strategic investments in open innovation models such\n",

In addition, to identify exogenous variation in leadership as much as possible, we consider deep lags in the patent stock variable, under the assumption that deep lags are less likely to be correlated with contemporaneous error terms in the regression.

Also, they are likely to know how to select better portfolio companies given their strong technology base, and are more likely to extract positive synergies between the portfolio companies and their own capabilities. Technology followers, however, show no signiﬁcant reaction to competition, even when they have used CVC as an option in the past. Because we control for ﬁrm size and free cash ﬂow, these ﬁndings are likely not driven by differences in ﬁnancial conditions between technology leaders and slow starters. To the extent that patent applications may vary across the IT-producing industry, the patent stock variable may reﬂect institutional features of the industry (Aghion et al. 2005, Hall et al. 2001). Therefore, we also use total R&D spending to measure technological capability (Alcacer and Chung 2007) and follow the same deep-lag approach to identifying technology leaders. The results are fully robust and are available on request. Replacing the sales-normalized CVC investment with the CVC/(CVC + R&D) variable allows us to gauge the relative importance of CVC over R&D across ﬁrm technology capabilities (see columns (4)–(6) of\n",

Finally, we examine the link between CVC investments and ex-post innovative output (H5) in Table 6, contingent on technology leadership deﬁned above. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant and different impact of CVC investment on innovative output between technology leaders and slow starters for both the ﬁxed-effects Poisson and pre-sample mean (labeled BGV) estimators. We ﬁnd a robust positive association between CVC investment and innovation (measured by number of patents) only for technology leaders (see columns (3) and (4)). In columns (1) and (3) we control for ﬁrm-speciﬁc effects using the pre-sample mean approach and observe consistent results. We include total M&A spending per year as a control variable since it is possible that an increase in patenting can be attributed to M&A activity rather than CVC (Tong and Li 2011).

We interact these dummy variables with competition measures to examine the marginal effect of competition on CVC in these particular segments.

Nowak and Grantham (2000) argue that there were three forces at play in the software industry in the late 1990s. These forces were the move from a softwareexpert programming paradigm to the componentbased software development (CBSD) paradigm, the rise of globalization, and extremely low barriers to entry in the industry (low capital costs, high labor mobility).

These factors contribute to hyper-competition in software product markets, and to opportunities to use open innovation to access new knowledge. A similar dynamic occurred to a lesser degree in the hardware industry, where sustained technical innovation and lowered entry barriers led to the “platformization” of hardware (Bresnahan and Greenstein 1999), especially in the micro-computing segment. As the client-server model emerged and the PC industry grew, competition grew around distinct hardware platforms even as entry barriers dropped. Bresnahan and Greenstein (1999, p. 33) state, “Technical leadership is divided. Hardware and component markets are more competitive. Sellers complain, rather than brag, about the pace of change.” In such contexts, open innovation and the ability to tap into external innovation (i.e., CVC) became feasible and attractive. By contrast, the telecom industry was characterized by fewer but more dominant entities (“telcos” such as BellSouth), strong network effects, high entry barriers, regulation, and inﬂuential standard-setting agencies (Godoe 2000). In such contexts, technological progress was generated in ﬁrms rather than from an extended ecosystem of players, i.e., Large Technological Projects (LTP) rather than Large Technological Networks (LTN) (Godoe 2000).

Product similarity measures are not available for the SIC3 classiﬁcation; hence this measure is not included. The results in Table 8, Panel A, show that the relationship between competition based on SIC3 and CVC investment is generally positive and signiﬁcant in the case of the OLS and FE regressions.

Here too, although the FE and OLS regressions provide significant positive coefﬁcients, subsequent models yield positive but insigniﬁcant coefﬁcients. Because competition in IT industries is intense and time varying, the TNIC-based measures are likely to be more suitable as they accurately capture competitive pressures faced by focal ﬁrms, and therefore better explain CVC activities relative to SIC-based or NAICS-based industries. Controlling for Other Forms of External Innovation Although we treat CVC as a form of external innovation spending by the focal ﬁrm, we acknowledge that there are other forms of external innovation spending that the ﬁrm can also use including acquisitions, alliances, and joint ventures.

            "We start by examining the baseline relationship between product market competition and ﬁrm-level innovation spending. Considerable prior work in studying this relationship has provided conﬂicting results, indicating that an industry-speciﬁc focus can better inform this question. We focus on the ITproducing industry, and ask two inter-related questions: First, do ﬁrms in the fast moving IT-producing industry respond to increased product market competition by investing more in internal R&D? Second, do ﬁrms prefer investments in CVC relative\n",

We also show that, although the managerial literature on open innovation (Chesbrough 2006) as well as formal models (Aghion et al. 2005, Fulghieri and Sevilir 2009) argue that diverting spending to sources such as CVC may be appropriate in more competitive environments, to our knowledge there is no clear empirical evidence in the literature of these shifts. Through a series of analyses, we show that IT ﬁrms do spend more on CVC vis-à-vis internal R&D as a response to competition. Not all IT ﬁrms appear to beneﬁt from CVC investments. Our analysis shows that technology leaders are more likely to respond to competition through the use of CVC and, correspondingly, also beneﬁt from such activities through an increase in innovative output. This presents a conditional argument for the use of CVC, and by extension, the use of open innovation models for IT ﬁrms: CVC may be a valuable strategy to acquire intellectual property (or knowledge) from the outside only if the ﬁrm has internal\n",

            "technological expertise. Chesbrough (2006, p. 14) indicates as much: “You cannot be an informed consumer of external ideas and technology if you don’t have some very sharp people working in your own organization.” Therefore, while we show that ﬁrms tend to divert some innovation spending from internal R&D to CVC as competition increases, our analysis also indicates that there are limits to how much CVC may be used if it involves starving internal R&D. Our results provide a complementary ﬁnding to the existing IS literature that indicates the value of knowledge capabilities enabled by IT investments in ﬁrms, especially in turbulent environments (Joshi et al. 2010, Pavlou and El Sawy 2010). While this research suggests that IT-enabled knowledge capabilities make the ﬁrm better at managing market conditions under volatility, our work indicates that, on the supply side of innovation, internal innovation capabilities are necessary to effectively use opportunities provided by innovation models such as CVC. Our work is also subject to certain limitations, which we summarize here. First, we use novel measures of competition based on 10-K textual network product similarities. This approach is motivated by seminal studies linking product differentiation to competition including Chamberlin (1933) and Hotelling (1929). However, although we also consider the LI, a limitation is that there are other aspects of competition beyond product differentiation. Examples of other innovative ways to measure competition include news articles (Kim et al. 2015) and Internet trafﬁc at the SEC’s EDGAR website (Lee et al. 2015). Despite the existence of such alternatives, we focus on TNIC total similarities because they offer many advantages relevant for our sample of ﬁrms in the U.S. IT industry where hyper-competition is present. Most notably they are updated dynamically year-toyear. Also, Hoberg and Phillips (2016) illustrate why they are substantially more powerful than the traditional SIC code based approach. A second limitation is that we are unable to locate a fully exogenous instrument for product market competition in our setting. To mitigate this concern, we report a variety of empirical speciﬁcations to establish the robustness of our ﬁndings. Corroborating our results using exogenous policy shocks would be useful in further establishing the causal relationship between product market competition and CVC spending, and represents a fruitful avenue for future research. We now brieﬂy discuss the implications of our work for practice and theory. Our work has implications for management of innovative ﬁrms in IT-producing industries with an ongoing interest in CVC as a source of innovative ideas. Increasing competition in IT-producing markets is a potent force and requires ﬁrms to effectively use elements of open innovation in their portfolios. To the extent that entrepreneurs\n",
            "\n",
            "and independent research units have strong incentives for innovating and are more nimble than traditional R&D units, IT ﬁrms should ﬁnd value in CVC activities. Still, our ﬁndings suggest that CVC strategies of IT ﬁrms should vary depending on their knowledge leadership. For technology leaders, we show that a strategic move into CVC has signiﬁcant beneﬁts in the form of patenting. For technology slow starters, it may be better to focus ﬁrst on improving internal R&D before incurring the risks of CVC. However, in the long run, technology leaders should retain a balance between internal R&D and CVC spending; internal technological expertise is necessary to continue extracting knowledge from external innovation. Our work focuses on the IT-producing sector but an open question pertains to whether similar relationships extend to other CVC contexts, such as biotechnology where a signiﬁcant proportion of CVC activity is noted. There is limited work in the literature where contrasts between the IT and biotechnology industries have been made. However, we can provide some initial conjectures about how competition may inﬂuence the biotechnology industry. If CVC is viewed as a means of acquiring knowledge and learning about new technologies, and if this is of particular relevance in biotechnology (Katila et al. 2008), then CVC is likely to be attractive (Van de Vrande et al. 2006). However, scholars have argued that while part of the motivation in IT may be to acquire valuable IP through acquisitions and through a weak IP regime (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005b), the beneﬁts of CVC in biotechnology arise from the ability to form inter-ﬁrm alliances or licensing arrangements (Gompers and Lerner 2001). In such cases, the entrepreneur’s IP is still protected but the entrepreneur gains through access to the investing ﬁrm’s complementary assets (Basu et al. 2011). Therefore, the reason for investing in CVC is not identical to the reasons observed for IT-producing ﬁrms. In addition, biotechnology and pharma ﬁrms experience different dynamics in terms of competition: Product development cycles are long, expensive, and highly regulated, with considerable revenues coming from few products. In such contexts, the response to competition is built not on shorter-term product development, as in IT, but in long-term alliance building and complementary use of open innovation with other mechanisms such as licensing, co-production, and joint ventures (Van de Vrande et al. 2006). Thus, the relationship between competition and CVC may not be as signiﬁcant as that noted in IT-producing industries. Future research is needed to rigorously compare these two industries and to formally test these conjectures. Our study extends current research on the evolving concept of open innovation models in the IT context.\n",

            "While our focus is speciﬁcally CVC, the literature discusses many other forms of open innovation that may be useful to ﬁrms, such as user innovation, crowdsourcing, and technological alliances (Han et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2014, Leimeister et al. 2009). Our work clearly indicates that while the ability to use open innovation models, given the low levels of investments necessary vis-à-vis traditional R&D may exist across all ﬁrms, technology leaders are more likely to achieve successful assimilation of new knowledge realized through open innovation. Therefore, when considering the returns on investment from open innovation models, attributes of the investing ﬁrm and its capabilities should be considered. Research that focuses on data or models speciﬁc to one ﬁrm will miss these elements and hence systematically show high or low returns. We argue that a broad-based view of the value of open innovation models is necessary, much the same way a systematic attempt at understanding IT business value was undertaken in the IS community in the 1990s (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2008). Finally, we add to the small but growing literature in the IS community that addresses entrepreneurship and VC-related topics, especially given the large contribution that the IT industry has made to the broader entrepreneurship and VC industries (Aggarwal et al. 2012, Gompers and Lerner 2001). During our study, the majority of VC and CVC investments were made in the IT-producing segment of the economy. We believe there is a natural home for examinations of research questions pertaining to entrepreneurship in the IS community, particularly when viewed through a technological lens. Our analysis of the varying behavior of software, hardware, and telecommunications ﬁrms in terms of CVC investments is a ﬁrst step in this direction and represents many opportunities for future work at the nexus of IT, entrepreneurship, and innovation.

            "Abstract. While human beings embody a unique ability for planned behaviour, they also often act automatically. In this study, we draw on the automatic thinking perspective as a meta-theoretic lens to explain why online auction bidders succumb to both trait impulsiveness and sunk cost, ultimately leading them to experience winner’s regret. Based on a survey of 301 online auction participants, we demonstrate that both trait impulsiveness as an emotional trigger and sunk cost as a cognitive trigger promote winner’s regret. By grounding our research model in the automatic thinking view, we provide an alternative meta-theoretical lens from which to view online bidder behaviour, thus bolstering our current understanding of winner’s regret. We also investigate the moderating effects of competition intensity on the relationships between the triggers of automatic thinking and winner’s regret. Our results show that both trait impulsiveness and sunk cost have signiﬁcant impacts on winner’s regret. We also found that the relationship between these two triggers and winner’s regret is moderated by competition intensity.

            "Online consumer-to-consumer (C2C) auction sites have become increasingly popular since the founding of eBay in 1995. Millions of consumers visit online auction sites, and these sites have become an important channel for acquiring goods. While consumers can sometimes save money by using online auction sites, participating in online auctions often comes at a price. For example, consumers may ﬁnd themselves spending more time than they would like to admit obsessively tracking the status of an auction. Worse yet, consumers may experience ‘auction fever’ and get so caught up with winning the auction that they end up experiencing ‘winner’s regret’ (Ku et al., 2005; Peters & Bodkin, 2007), deﬁned here as winning the auction but with the subjective emotional assessment of having overpaid for the item. Prior research on auctions has often referred to winner’s regret as the winner’s curse (Foreman & Murhighan, 1996; Amyx & Luehlﬁng, 2006;\n",

            "Malhotra, 2010; Adam et al., 2011). In this paper, we use the term winner’s regret rather than winner’s curse because winner’s curse usually implies that the winning bidder pays more than an auction item is worth. The term winner’s regret does not carry this connotation and is deﬁned here as regret associated with the subjective emotional assessment of having overpaid for an item (regardless of whether the amount paid actually exceeds what the item is objectively worth). In order to gain a better understanding of why winner’s regret occurs in online auctions, we introduce the perspective of automatic thinking as a meta-theoretical frame. For a long time, economists have maintained that human behaviour is best described by the rational economic model, which basically holds that human beings are self-interested and capable of perfectly weighing the costs and beneﬁts in every decision, thus enabling optimal choices (Ariely, 2008). Although human beings do, in fact, frequently make rational decisions, this does not necessarily mean that they do this all, or even most, of the time. In line with this argument, psychologists distinguish between two modes of thinking, one that is intuitive and automatic, and another that is reﬂective and rational (Thaler & Sunstein, 2009; Kahneman, 2011). Thaler & Sunstein (2009) refer to the ﬁrst mode as automatic thinking. Automatic thinking provides a useful perspective for understanding the problem of winner’s regret, because automatic thinking is rapid and instinctual (Bazerman & Moore, 2009). For example, when people get nervous during a ﬂight that experiences turbulence or smile when they see a cute baby, they are using automatic thinking. In the online auction context, automatic thinking may help to explain why individuals experience auction fever and get so caught up in the auction process (Heyman et al., 2004; Ku et al., 2005). Despite often-voiced concerns regarding the pitfalls of auction fever, the problem of winner’s regret and why it occurs has not been examined from the perspective of automatic thinking. There are two types of triggers that result in automatic thinking: emotional triggers (Strack & Deutsch, 2004; Slovic et al., 2007; Hofmann et al., 2009) and cognitive triggers (Sloman, 1996; Kahneman, 2003; Klaczynski & Cottrill, 2004; Hofmann et al., 2009). Therefore, we believe that it is important to consider both emotional and cognitive triggers of automatic thinking in order to obtain a more complete understanding why winner’s regret occurs. In this study, we thus explore two factors related to the automatic thinking that may inﬂuence winner’s regret; trait impulsiveness, which is believed to be more emotional in nature, and sunk cost, which is believed to be more cognitive in nature. We chose these two factors because they are known to inﬂuence behaviour in related contexts. For example, escalation of commitment scholars have long suspected that sunk cost can create the kind of loss framing that is believed to promote escalation behaviour, and marketing researchers have pointed to impulsiveness as a trait that can inﬂuence retail buying behaviour. In addition to these two factors, competition intensity has been shown to affect bidding behaviour in online auctions, and we include it in our study to determine if it moderates the relationship between these automatic thinking triggers and winner’s regret. In summary, our aim is to better understand winner’s regret by considering both emotional and cognitive triggers of automatic thinking and the role of competition intensity in this context. In doing so, we seek to answer two research questions: 1 To what extent do emotional and cognitive triggers of automatic thinking help us to predict winner’s regret?\n",

            "2 To what extent is the relationship between these automatic thinking triggers and winner’s regret moderated by competition intensity? While prior research has examined the impact of certain escalation drivers such as sunk cost on willingness to continue bidding (Park et al., 2012) and how this can result in overbidding behaviour, we know of no research that has examined the effect of both cognitive and emotional triggers on winner’s regret.1 Thus, by addressing the previous research questions, we contribute to the current body of knowledge regarding individuals’ behaviour in online auctions. From the standpoint of theoretical contribution, ours is the ﬁrst study to draw on the lens of automatic thinking to examine two kinds of triggers (one cognitive and one emotional) that may contribute to winner’s regret. Speciﬁcally, by investigating the impact of sunk cost and impulsiveness as well as the moderating role of competition intensity, we shed new light on the phenomenon of winner’s regret in online auctions.\n",

            "Online auctions and winner’s regret Online auctions are conducted over the internet and differ from traditional auctions in some important respects. First, online auctions remove the geographical constraints of traditional auctions, thus enabling worldwide participation (Ariely & Simonson, 2003). Second, online auctions can last for several days and can allow for asynchronous bidding, which makes them more ﬂexible than traditional auctions and easier for people to participate in. While online auctions are attractive in several respects, prior research has documented a number of problems associated with participating in them. These include psychological distress (i.e. anxiety, aggression, anger and depression), habitual usage, negative impacts on ﬁnances or social relations and dependency and withdrawal symptoms (Peters & Bodkin, 2007). One problem, which is the focus of our research, is winner’s regret, deﬁned here as regret associated with the subjective emotional assessment of having overpaid for an item (regardless of whether the amount paid actually exceeds what the item is objectively worth). The emotion of regret stems from the comparison of an actual outcome with a better outcome that might have resulted. In an online auction context, individuals may experience regret when they compare the actual price that they paid with their reservation price (i.e. the highest price a buyer is willing to pay). While consumers may participate in online auctions to obtain a bargain, the reality is that in many instances they end up either overpaying for what they purchase or experience regret associated with the subjective emotional assessment of having overpaid for an item. Based on an analysis of 500 online auctions for compact discs and digital video discs, Ariely & Simonson\n",

            "Overbidding generally refers to situations in which individuals bid beyond their reservation price. Thus, overbidding need not necessarily result in winning an auction or in winner’s regret, because many auction participants may engage in overbidding but only one person will win the auction. The distinction is important because winner’s regret could inﬂuence an individual’s willingness to use online auctions in the future.\n",

            "(2003) reported that 98% of all winning bidders overpaid. Overpayment can be reduced by providing bidders with an easy means of checking the retail prices of goods. Based on a sample of 416 online auctions, Amyx & Luehlﬁng (2006) found that only 8.7% of the winning bidders overpaid when they were using auction sites that provided links to websites that allowed bidders to check the reference price of identical retail merchandise available for sale at the same website. Naturally, when a bidder believes that he or she has paid too much for an item of uncertain value (Ku et al., 2005; Robert et al., 2011), regret can occur. A rational explanation for such regret can be formulated based on three assumptions: (1) while the average bidder may accurately estimate the value of the item up for sale in an auction, some bidders will underestimate this value and others will overestimate it; (2) the bidder who most greatly overestimates the value of the item will typically win the auction; and (3) the amount of overestimation will often be greater than the difference between the winning bidder’s estimate of the value of the item and what s/he ultimately had to bid in order to acquire it (Amyx & Luehlﬁng, 2006). Under this view, regret occurs as a result of uncertainty regarding an object’s value, and thus, bidders can be economically rational and still suffer regret when their information is poor. Empirical evidence suggests that regret can arise even when bidders have perfect information (Ariely & Simonson, 2003; Amyx & Luehlﬁng, 2006), and thus, the behaviour that leads up to this can be viewed as irrational. Oh (2002) examined regret in consumer-to-consumer auctions and concluded that bidders do not necessarily behave in an economically rational way. Speciﬁcally, they tend to bid on items for the sheer enjoyment that is intrinsic in an online competition, rather than on the basis of utility in pure monetary terms. Furthermore, online auctions can produce an emotionally charged climate in which individuals try to outbid one another in the hopes of acquiring a product (Turel et al., 2011). Given that competition intensity can be high in some auctions and that things typically become more intense as the auction nears completion, the longer an individual remains engaged in the bidding process the more likely it is that s/he will experience strong emotions (Adam et al., 2011). Those who experience auction fever may ﬁnd that they have little control over their bidding and buying behaviour, ultimately spending more than they anticipated and experiencing negative feelings such as regret as a result. Thus, whether bidding behaviour is seen as rational or irrational, and whether overpayment is real (in an objective sense relative to a reference price that represents an item’s actual worth) or not the subjective emotional assessment of having overpaid for an item is a problem that is relevant for both research and practice, as winner’s regret can cause customer dissatisfaction (Amyx & Luehlﬁng, 2006). Customers who are dissatisﬁed with their online auction experience are less likely to return to the auction site, and this can be damaging to online auction service providers. Unfortunately, little is known about the factors that lead to winner’s regret, deﬁned here as regret associated with the subjective emotional assessment of having overpaid for an item (regardless of whether the amount paid actually exceeds what the item is objectively worth). Park et al. (2012) investigated how key escalation drivers (e.g. completion effect, selfjustiﬁcation and sunk cost) affect an individual’s willingness to continue bidding, which in turn leads to overbidding behaviour (i.e. bidding in excess of one’s reservation price regardless of whether or not one wins the auction). Their study dealt with overbidding behaviour and did not consider examine winner’s regret per se. Moreover, they did not examine any emotional\n",

            "triggers that might be associated with this phenomenon. In this paper, we explore the problem of winner’s regret using the automatic thinking perspective as a meta-theoretical lens. Automatic thinking Automatic thinking is one of two information processing approaches that guide human perception, memory, decision and attention. Automatic thinking involves rapid and parallel processing and requires little effort. Schneider & Shiffrin (1977) distinguish automatic thinking from reﬂective thinking, which is much slower. Automatic thinking does not require higher-order mental operations, which include executive functions such as making deliberate judgments and evaluations (Strack & Deutsch, 2004). In other words, automatic thinking tends to be involuntary and requires no attention, whereas reﬂective thinking is voluntary and requires attention. Moors & De Houwer (2006) also reviewed the characteristics that distinguish automatic thinking from reﬂective thinking, concluding that one of the most important distinctions between the two is the degree to which actions are subject to conscious control. When peoples’ activities are automatic, they tend to be more likely to occur autonomously, i.e. they appear to occur on their own in the absence of central control. A third characteristic of automatic thinking is its inherent attentional efﬁciency. Generally speaking, activities associated with automatic thinking occur with a minimum of attentional capacity, which leaves more capacity for the performance of other tasks. Finally, automatic thinking can be quite difﬁcult to stop or modify, because it involves relatively little in the way of conscious monitoring. In the context of online auctions, automatic thinking may explain why individuals are prone to overpayment (either real or perceived) and to experience regret as a result. Ariely & Simonson (2003) demonstrated previously that overpayment in online auctions can be conceptualised as a form of automatic thinking, in which bidders lose their self-control and get caught up in the bidding process. The key features of automatic thinking and how they apply to online auction behaviour are shown in Table 1. Both cognitive and emotional factors can trigger automatic thinking. While cognitive factors often connote reﬂective thinking, this need not necessarily be the case. In other words, there may be aspects of cognition that remain somewhat opaque to reﬂective processes or that occur with such frequency that they become automatic over time. An example of the latter would be when driving a car and we come to a red light, we automatically know to stop and we engage the brake on the automobile. Clearly, there is cognition taking place in this action, but it is not something that we consciously think about unless we are a new driver. This example illustrates how something that at one time required reﬂection can become automatic with sufﬁcient practice. There\n",

            "are also instances in which cognitive factors inﬂuence our decision-making without our being fully aware of their impact. One example of this is sunk cost. Arkes & Blumer (1985) showed that when individuals invest in season tickets, they attend more shows. Presumably, this is because they have incurred sunk cost in buying the season tickets. However, if you were to ask these individuals why they chose to attend more shows, they might not even be aware that sunk cost was a factor inﬂuencing their attendance decisions. In this sense, sunk cost can be viewed as a cognitive factor that may operate at a subconscious level, resulting in automatic thinking. While sunk cost should not inﬂuence decisions from a rational economic perspective, numerous studies (e.g. Arkes & Blumer, 1985) have found that individuals ﬁnd it difﬁcult to ignore sunk cost when they make decisions. Moreover, the concept of sunk cost is not limited to ﬁnancial investments but also extends to investments of time and effort. Consistent with prospect theory, the effect of sunk cost on decision-making is believed to arise from the manner in which decisions are framed (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Speciﬁcally, prior research has shown that individuals are more risk-seeking when decisions are framed as a choice between losses, and sunk cost can induce such a framing. Essentially, sunk costs evoke a loss framing, and this triggers risk-seeking behaviour in accordance with prospect theory. In the online auction context, ‘previous bids and/or time invested in the auction represent sunk costs’ (Ku et al., 2005, p. 92). Consistent with Park et al. (2012), we posit that individuals perceive sunk costs as losses that can only be recouped if the individual wins the auction. It is also possible that sunk cost (in the form of time and effort) may lead to the endowment effect, which refers to the fact that people tend to ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Research on the endowment effect has shown that owners often value an item at more than twice the level that an average buyer is willing to pay (Thaler, 1980; Kahneman et al., 1990). Carmon & Ariely (2000) suggest that this disparity can be interpreted as form of loss aversion on the part of owners. Speciﬁcally, when one owns an item, giving it up is viewed as a loss, and it is well known that individuals exhibit loss aversion (Carmon & Ariely, 2000; Looney & Hardin, 2009; Hardin & Looney, 2012). In an online auction context, sunk costs associated with the bidding process may cause bidders to become so attached to what they are bidding on they begin to develop a sense of ownership over the item. If this occurs, the endowment effect may result in bidders’ overestimating the value of the item just as owners tend to overvalue their possessions. Indeed, prior research on online auctions has offered some empirical support for product attachment as a cause of overpayment (e.g. Carmon & Ariely, 2000; Ariely & Simonson, 2003). At some point, the idea of ‘losing’ the item by not winning the auction creates behaviour that is consistent with loss aversion. Loss aversion can be explained by the value function of prospect theory and the fact that individuals weigh losses roughly two and a half times greater than equivalent gains (Looney & Hardin, 2009). In sum, sunk costs (in the form of time and effort) may produce a loss framing or create an endowment effect that leads to loss aversion, either of which could theoretically result in bidding behaviour that can result in winner’s regret. Regardless of the exact mechanism through which sunk cost inﬂuences bidding behaviour, we suggest that it serves as cognitive trigger for automatic thinking in the online auction context and that it may lead to winner’s regret. In addition to cognitive factors, emotional factors can also trigger automatic thinking. Prior research suggests that people often make snap decisions based on their emotional state (Ariely &\n",

            "Simonson, 2003; Amyx & Luehlﬁng, 2006). Thus, emotions can inﬂuence an individual’s decision-making without the individual even being aware of the impact. For example, the angrier one feels, ‘the more one perceives others as responsible for a negative event’ (Lerner & Tiedens, 2006, p. 118). Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated that strong emotions can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on decision-making behaviour (see, for example, Andrade & Ariely, 2009). In this research, we posit that emotional as well as cognitive factors can inﬂuence online bidding behaviour. One emotional factor that can trigger automatic thinking in the online auction context is trait impulsiveness. Trait impulsiveness involves a tendency to act on a whim, displaying behaviour characterised by little or no forethought, reﬂection or consideration of consequences (VandenBos, 2007). Trait impulsiveness has been linked to automatic thinking (Hofmann et al., 2009), and in the marketing literature, it has been shown to inﬂuence buying behaviour (Rook, 1987; Rook & Fisher, 1995). Individuals who are impulsive are more likely to acquire products when presented with the opportunity (Rook & Fisher, 1995). Presumably, this is because trait impulsiveness promotes automatic thinking, causing individuals to make decisions without consciously weighing costs and beneﬁts. An example of such impulsiveness is when an individual enters a supermarket with a list of groceries to buy and encounters a display case of candy bars in a prominently placed location near the checkout. Without necessarily weighing the costs and beneﬁts associated with the purchase, individuals may be inclined to make an impulse purchase and buy themselves a treat that they had not intended to buy. When this occurs, it is often because the individual has an emotional reaction to seeing the product. In this sense, impulsiveness can be viewed as an emotional factor that operates at a subconscious level, resulting in automatic thinking. In this research, we investigate trait impulsiveness as an emotional trigger for automatic thinking in the online auction context, which may lead to winner’s regret. While the impact of trait impulsiveness has not been explored in the online auction context, prior research does suggest that emotional factors (e.g. competitive arousal) can play a role in bidding behaviour (Ku et al., 2005). Although prior research has suggested that both cognitive and emotional factors may affect online bidding behaviour, the combined effect of these two types of factors has not been examined within the conﬁnes of a single study. Table 2 provides a representative list of 11 studies that have sought to identify cognitive or emotional factors that affect online auction outcomes. The list is not intended to be exhaustive, but it contains the major studies that have been published in this area, and we believe it is representative of online auction studies that have focused particular attention on bidding behaviour. As shown in Table 2, the studies that have been conducted to date invariably focus on either the cognitive aspects of why bidders decide to make bids or the emotional aspects that drive bidding behaviour. In order to better understand bidding behaviour in online auctions, however, we believe that it is important to consider both cognitive and emotional factors in researching this phenomenon, and this is the approach taken here.\n",

            "impulsiveness are posited to have direct effects on winner’s regret. Both of these relationships, however, are posited to be moderated by competition intensity, which serves as a situational moderator. Trait impulsiveness is the tendency to act on a whim, with little or no planning or reﬂection. This construct has been studied extensively by both marketing researchers and clinical psychologists. For example, in the marketing area, Rook & Fisher (1995, p. 306) conceptualised impulsiveness as a consumer trait and deﬁned it as the tendency to buy ‘spontaneously, unreﬂectively, immediately, and kinetically’. In the context of retail shopping, individuals who rated higher on trait impulsiveness have been found to be more likely to experience powerful and persistent urges to buy something immediately and to act on these urges (Beatty & Ferrell, 1997). Marketing researchers agree that impulsive buying involves an instant-gratiﬁcation component (Rook & Fisher, 1995; Hausman, 2000) and that such behaviour occurs in the spur of the moment (Angst et al., 2008). Just as trait impulsiveness can inﬂuence purchase behaviour in retail settings, we believe that it can inﬂuence behaviour in an online auction context. Specifically, we posit that impulsive individuals will be more likely to repeatedly engage in ‘spur of the moment’ bidding decisions, making them more likely to bid past their reservation price without really thinking about the consequences of their behaviour. Further, evidence from clinical psychology research suggests that trait impulsiveness is associated with an inability to suppress emotional urges. For example, Doran et al. (2004) examined that the inﬂuence of trait impulsiveness on the smokers’ ability to maintain abstinence following a 1 day smoking cessation workshop. They found that higher levels of trait impulsiveness were predictive of a more rapid return to smoking following 48 h of nicotine abstinence. In line with this, Mitchell (1999) also found that smokers with high trait impulsiveness have greater difﬁculty inhibiting smoking than other smokers. Based on the preceding text, it appears that individuals with high trait impulsiveness have difﬁculty inhibiting their emotional urges and are thus more likely to experience ‘auction fever’. In other words, individuals who are impulsive are more likely to get emotionally caught up in the dynamics of the bidding process. Thus, we suspect that individuals who have high trait impulsiveness are more likely to continue bidding without careful consideration of whether their bid\n",

            "The sunk cost effect, which has been explained from a prospect theory perspective (Whyte, 1986), occurs when an individual’s decision-making is inﬂuenced by prior investments of time, effort or money that are not recoverable. In the online auction context, ‘previous bids and/or time invested in the auction represent sunk costs’ (Ku et al., 2005, p. 92). As the auction progresses, individuals will tend to perceive sunk cost to be greater as their investment of time and effort becomes higher. Consistent with Park et al. (2012), we posit that sunk costs are perceived as losses that can only be recouped if the individual continues to participate in the auction. Thus, in an illusory attempt to recover their sunk cost, individuals may actually bid beyond their reservation price, ultimately leading to winner’s regret should they win the auction. As noted earlier, it is also possible that sunk cost (in the form of time and effort) may lead to the endowment effect and that this results in overestimation of value, leading to overbidding and subsequently winner’s regret. Both theoretical mechanisms suggest the following hypothesis:\n",

            "In the online auction context, individuals are faced with the need to make rapid decisions and are often unable to reﬂect and conduct research that would guide their bidding behaviour. As a result, people often imitate others (Bonabeau, 2004). Such imitative behaviour can lead to the formation of informational cascades (Bikhchandani et al., 1992). Informational cascades occur when individuals follow the previous behaviour of others and disregard their own information. Previous studies on informational cascades have highlighted the importance of social inﬂuence in decision-making. On the basis of prior research (Gilkeson & Reynolds, 2003; Johns & Zaichkowsky, 2003; Ku et al., 2005), it is reasonable to assume that decision dynamics can be impacted by competition intensity. Park et al. (2012) found that the strength of the relationship between bidders’ willingness to continue bidding and overbidding behaviour was greater when competition intensity was higher. Ariely & Simonson (2003) suggest that most auction participants perceive other bidders as ‘competitors’ and associate auction outcomes with ‘winning’ and ‘losing’. Ku et al. (2005) suggest that competition intensity produces ‘competitive arousal’, an emotional state that causes individuals to shift from a motivation to acquire a product for a reasonable price to a motivation to win the auction at any cost (Ku et al., 2005). Their competitive arousal model places special emphasis on two antecedents of competitive arousal: heightened perceptions of rivalry and increasing time pressure (which characteristically occurs as an auction nears completion). Based on the preceding text, we expect there to be an interaction between competition intensity and trait impulsiveness such that a more intense competitive environment can stimulate those with high trait impulsiveness to be even more likely to bid past their reservation price, thus increasing the chances that they will experience winner’s regret. Thus, we offer the following hypothesis:\n",

            "In the online auction context, bidders invest their time and effort. These investments represent sunk costs and can only be recovered if the auction is eventually won. Ku et al. (2005) reported that high sunk costs lead to increased self-reported levels of arousal and higher bidding activity. They argued that if bidding itself is arousing, this can ‘feed a vicious cycle of bidding’. In line with this, Park et al. (2012) found that auction participants’ willingness to continue to bidding is inﬂuenced by sunk cost. Interestingly, their results also suggest that competition intensity moderates the relationship between sunk cost and willingness to continue bidding, such that the effect of sunk cost is weakened under conditions of high competition intensity. They also reported that sunk cost had a direct effect on overbidding when competition intensity was low, but not when competition intensity was high. Together, these results indicate that competition intensity can play an important moderating role in this context, weakening the effect of sunk cost. Moon (2001) suggests that the effect of sunk cost differs depending on whether an individual is focused on the past or the future, and this provides a possible theoretical explanation as to why the sunk cost effect may be weakened when competition intensity is high. Speciﬁcally, the effect of sunk cost is theorised to be less potent when an individual is thinking about the future as opposed to the past. As Moon (2001) suggests, sunk cost causes decision-makers to think about the past, which leads them to try and recover monies already spent by continuing a previously chosen course of action. However, as competition intensity increases, we theorise that individuals become more absorbed in the auction dynamics and begin to envision a future state in which the auction is over and they also begin to realise that they may or may not win the auction. Moreover, as competition intensity increases, individuals are more likely to experience the effects of competitive arousal, which is an adrenaline-laden emotional state that can arise during highly competitive bidding (Ku et al., 2005). According to the competitive arousal model of Ku et al. (2005), there are two key antecedents of competitive arousal: heightened rivalry and increasing time pressure. These conditions can create an environment in which the desire to win the auction becomes so strong that it can lead to dysfunctional behaviour (Malhotra, 2010). We propose that when competition intensity is high, the combined effects of heightened rivalry and time pressure are likely to overshadow any effects of previous investments in time and effort (i.e. sunk cost). If competition intensity is high enough, competitive arousal could even create an environment in which bidders are willing to pay more than item is worth just to deprive other bidders from obtaining the item. If this occurs, the gratiﬁcation that comes from winning the auction at any cost may diminish the negative feelings that would normally be associated with winner’s regret. Thus, the relationship between sunk cost and winner’s regret may be weakened under conditions of high competition intensity. Thus, we expect that high competition intensity causes individuals not to think about the past but rather to focus on the future, and can even lead to situations where there is gratiﬁcation associated with depriving others from winning the auction, thereby weakening the effect of sunk cost on winner’s regret. Therefore, we expect that under conditions of high competition intensity, the effect of sunk cost on bidding behaviour is weakened and the predictive value of sunk cost on winner’s regret is reduced. Based on this logic, we advance the following hypothesis:\n",

            "Research approach and construct operationalisation We employed a survey approach in order to test our research model (see Appendix A for our measures, which were all based on self-reports). Impulsiveness was operationalised using a four-item scale (IMP1–IMP4) adapted and modiﬁed from Rook & Fisher (1995), which was designed to assess the extent to which an individual acts spontaneously without thinking of the consequences. Sunk cost was operationalised using a three-item scale (SC1–SC3) adapted from Park et al. (2012), which captured the extent to which the bidder perceived that it would be difﬁcult to stop bidding due to prior investment of time or effort in the auction process. Competition intensity was operationalised using a three-item scale from Park et al. (2012). These measures were designed to tap into the number of people competing in the auction and how ﬁerce the competition was perceived to be (CI1–CI3). Our dependent variable, winner’s regret, was assessed using a single-item measure designed to capture regret associated with the subjective emotional assessment of having overpaid for an item. Single-item scales are frequently seen as being less reliable than multiitem scales, but ‘as far as internal consistency reliability is concerned, there is substantial evidence indicating acceptable reliability values for single-item scales’ (Fuchs & Diamantopoulos, 2009, p. 201). Single-item scales also tend to raise concerns regarding the assessment of convergent and discriminant validity, but again, the available evidence suggests that ‘single-item measures can be both reliable and valid’ (Wanous et al., 1997; Robins et al., 2001; Wanous & Hudy, 2001; Fuchs & Diamantopoulos, 2009, p. 203). The issue of whether or not to use a single-item measure depends on a variety of factors, but the nature of the construct is certainly an important consideration (Fuchs & Diamantopoulos, 2009; Petrescu, 2013). Petrescu (2013) notes that single-item measures can be used to assess concepts that are simple and easy to understand. This includes not only concrete concepts, such as sales or expenditures, but also behavioural constructs, such as repeat purchase intention. Fuchs & Diamantopoulos (2009) suggest that it is reasonable to employ single-item measures for unidimensional constructs where there is broad agreement as to what the construct means (e.g. favorability, price perception and buying intention). In our case, the winner’s regret construct was unidimensional and easy to understand, which made it possible to assess the construct with a single measurement item (‘After purchasing the item, I regretted that I had overpaid’). What makes the construct unidimensional is that it can be measured using a single ‘ruler’ that goes from low to high. While one could argue that the general concept of regret may have multiple dimensions (i.e. perhaps one may regret something for all kinds of different reasons), we are not attempting to capture the general concept of regret. Instead, we are focusing in on and measuring a very speciﬁc kind of regret (i.e. regret associated with the subjective\n",

In addition to the previous constructs, we controlled for four variables that might inﬂuence bidding and perceptions in our research setting: (1) opening price on the focal item, (2) the total number of bids placed on the focal item, (3) maximum bidding price submitted by the bidder and (4) gender.\n",

            "Instrument validation and data collection An initial version of the questionnaire was developed with the idea that each subject would be asked to respond based on his or her most recent online auction experience, answering questions about regret after winning an auction. Four bilingual individuals with domain expertise in online auctions and experience with survey design provided feedback that was used to reﬁne the questionnaire. The survey was developed in English and translated into Korean by two individuals who were ﬂuent in both English and Korean. Two other individuals who were also ﬂuent in both English and Korean performed a backward translation to ensure consistency between the Korean version of the measurement items and the original English version. Minor adjustments were then made to eliminate any translation-related differences and to ensure that the meaning was equivalent. The questionnaire was then pilot tested with 196 undergraduate students, allowing us to check the psychometric properties of the scales (Straub et al., 2004). Convergent validity of each scale was assessed using a principal components factor analysis. A separate principal components factor analysis was run for each of the constructs. A single eigenvalue above 1 for each construct veriﬁed that the construct was unidimensional, hence, providing evidence of convergent validity for each scale. An exploratory factor analysis with all constructs revealed a clean factor structure and exhibited item-to-construct loadings that exceeded the desired threshold of 0.5. Cronbach’s alpha was used to assess the reliability of our measures in the pilot test, and all scales were judged to exceed the normal threshold of 0.7 for reliability (Hair et al., 1998). Subsequent to the pilot test, we administered a Web-based survey that targeted individuals who had participated in online auctions using one of Korea’s leading online auction sites. We contracted with a market research ﬁrm, which agreed to administer the survey to Koreans with prior experience using online auctions to acquire goods. Our aim was to obtain a representative sample of auction users that included participants from different age ranges. We instructed the market research ﬁrm to obtain 500 responses and to restrict the sample to those who indicated they had some actual experience of buying products in online auctions. Participants were asked to recall an online auction that they had participated in within the last month in which they had actually won the auction and to complete the survey based on that auction experience. Five dollars of cyber-money was provided to each survey recipient as an incentive to complete the survey. A total of 500 responses were obtained, but some had to be dropped because they were not fully completed, leaving us with 479 completed surveys. Because we were interested in studying winner’s regret in online auctions, we restricted our analysis to survey respondents who indicated that they felt regret after purchasing their item. A total of 301 survey respondents met this threshold and these cases were retained for further analysis. Of the 301 usable responses, 70 respondents purchased clothes (23.3%), 88 respondents purchased consumer electronics\n",

We used PLS for our analysis as it (1) enabled us to estimate the measurement model and the structural model simultaneously, (2) is suitable for exploratory models and (3) has fewer distributional assumptions (Gefen & Straub, 2005).

            "Descriptive analysis Table 3 shows the demographic proﬁle of our respondents. 67.4% of our respondents were male and 32.6% were female. Most respondents (75.1%) were in the 21–40 years age group. Most respondents (46.2%) placed bids between one and three times and 27.2% of total respondents placed bids between four and six times. We employed two methods to test for common method bias (CMB) as it represents a potential threat to validity given our study design. First, we used Harman’s one-factor test (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986). According to Podsakoff & Organ (1986), if a single factor emerges from the factor analysis, this may be indicative of a serious CMB threat. In order to conduct this test, we entered all 11 measurement items into a principal component analysis and examined the results of the unrotated factor solution. Four factors were extracted, accounting for 26.39%, 24.38%, 24.21% and 8.90% of the variance, respectively. This result suggests that CMB was not a signiﬁcant threat in our study. Second, we conducted marker variable analysis per Lindell & Whitney (2001) in which unrelated constructs (termed marker variables) are used to adjust the correlations among the principle constructs. We identiﬁed two unrelated constructs (opening price and perceived ease of use), which were assessed as part of the survey. High correlations among any of the items of the study’s principal constructs and unrelated constructs would indicate common method bias as the constructs of opening price and perceived ease of use should be weakly related to the study’s principle constructs. The results of our marker variable analysis (described in Appendix F) suggest that common method bias was likely not a signiﬁcant threat in this study. Measurement model For the measurement model, each construct was modelled reﬂectively. The measurement model was tested by examining convergent and discriminant validity (Fornell & Larcker,\n",

Individual item reliability was assessed by examining the item-toconstruct loadings for each construct that was measured with multiple indicators. In order for the shared variance between each item and its associated construct to exceed the error variance, the standardised loadings should be greater than 0.70. As can be seen in Appendix B, all of our item to-construct loadings exceeded the desired threshold. The next step in establishing measurement reliability was to examine the internal consistency for each block of measures (i.e. construct reliability). This was performed by examining the composite reliability, Cronbach’s alpha and the average variance extracted (AVE) for each block of measures, as shown in Table 4. Composite reliability and Cronbach’s alpha both measure the internal consistency within a given construct’s items. The threshold values for composite reliability and Cronbach’s alpha are not absolute ones, but our measures appear to be more than acceptable by established criteria. Bearden et al. (1993) claim that a score of 0.7 indicates ‘extensive’ evidence of reliability and a score of 0.8 or higher provide ‘exemplary’ evidence. As shown in Table 4, all of the constructs in our measurement model exhibited composite reliabilities of 0.86 or higher, and they all exhibited Cronbach’s alpha of 0.80 or higher. The guideline threshold for AVE is 0.5, meaning that 50% or more variance of the indicators is accounted for Chin (1998). As Appendix C indicates, all of the constructs in our measurement model exceeded the established criteria for AVE. We conducted two tests for discriminant validity. First, we calculated each indicator’s loading on its own construct as well as its cross-loading on all other constructs (Appendix B). The loadings for the indicators for each construct are higher than the cross-loadings for other constructs’ indicators. Additionally, going across the rows, each indicator has a higher loading with its construct than a cross-loading with any other construct. This provides good evidence of discriminant validity (Chin, 1998, p. 321).\n",

As can be seen by reading across the rows of Appendix C, our measures passed this test, thus providing additional evidence of discriminant validity.\n",

As shown in Figure 2, the path between impulsiveness and winner’s regret (β = 0.276, t = 3.846) and the path between sunk cost and winner’s regret (β = 0.266, t = 3.628) were both signiﬁcant at p < 0.01. These results provide strong support for H1 and H2. None of the control variables were found to be signiﬁcant.

            "dependent variable (winner’s regret), we performed a subgroup analysis as explained in the succeeding text. Before embarking on a subgroup analysis for competition intensity (CI), we ﬁrst needed to determine whether CI acts as a moderator, and if so, what type of moderator it is. In order to investigate the moderating role of CI on the relationship between our two predictors (trait impulsiveness and sunk cost) and our criterion variable (winner’s regret), we followed the moderated regression analysis (MRA) procedure recommended by Sharma et al. (1981). Using MRA, one can determine the type of moderator based on a few simple rules. If there is an interaction effect and no direct effect with criterion or predictor variables, we can conclude that the variable is a pure moderator. If there is an interaction effect and a direct relationship with the predictor, the criterion variable or both, we can conclude that the variable is a quasimoderator. If there is neither a direct effect nor a moderation effect but the detected interaction derives from unequal measurement errors across subsamples, we can conclude that the variable is a homologiser. Based on the MRA procedure, and applying a strict p < 0.05 signiﬁcance threshold, we concluded that CI was a moderator, but that it is neither a pure moderator, nor a quasi-moderator. Instead, CI acts as a homologiser (Appendix D). A homologiser Z acts as moderator in that it inﬂuences the strength of the relationship between X (an independent variable) and Y (a dependent variable) but is not itself related to X or Y and does not interact with X. Under such circumstances, Z exerts its inﬂuence through the error term, and the appropriate way of analysing the moderating effect of Z is by partitioning the dataset and performing a subgroup analysis (Sharma et al., 1981; Allison et al., 1992). In order to do this, we split the sample into high competition intensity and low competition intensity subgroups. This was performed by splitting the sample at the mean value of CI (4.60), after which, we also tested both reliability and validity for each subgroup. Appendix B and Appendix C show that all items in the CI subgroup (n = 155) demonstrate acceptable loadings (0.788–0.950), as do all items in the low-CI subgroup (n = 146) (0.779–0.969). In addition, the reliability indicators are all well above accepted thresholds, and the AVEs are greater than 0.5.\n",

            "Following Carte & Russell’s (2003) suggestion, we assessed whether the latent constructs were perceived in a similar fashion between the high-CI and low-CI subgroups. An examination of Appendix B suggests that the loading patterns are very similar, thus suggesting that meaningful comparisons can be made between groups. In addition, a measurement invariance analysis was performed to further validate the similarity of measurement models between the two subgroups (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002). Appendix E provides support for measurement invariance, and on that basis, we concluded that meaningful path coefﬁcient comparisons could be made across subgroups. With the measurement model appearing to be stable and adequate across the subgroups, we proceeded to analyse the structural model for each subgroup. Consistent with the Sharma et al. (1981) approach for analysing a homologiser, we tested the moderating effect of competition intensity by estimating two separate models in PLS, namely, the high-CI subgroup and the low-CI subgroup. This approach allowed us to examine the moderating effect of CI by looking at the differences in the magnitude of the path coefﬁcient from impulsiveness to winner’s regret across groups using the approach suggested by Chin et al. (2003). This involved computing a t-statistic2 as follows: ﬃ qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ È É ½ðN À 1Þ=ðN 1 þ N 2 À 2ÞÂ½ðN 2 À 1Þ=N 1 þ N 2 À 2ÂSE 2 2 pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃÃ Â t ¼ ðPC 1 À PC 2 Þ= S pooled Â ð1=N 1 Þ þ ð1=N 2 Þ\n",

In other words, trait impulsiveness has a greater impact on winner’s regret when the level of competition is high, thus supporting H3, whereas sunk cost has a greater impact on winner’s regret when competition intensity is low, thus supporting H4. These ﬁndings indicate that the impact of trait impulsiveness as well as sunk cost on winner’s regret differs depending on the level of competition intensity.

Speciﬁcally, we found that competition intensity strengthens the relationship between impulsiveness and winner’s regret, but that it weakens the relationship between sunk cost and winner’s regret. Before turning to the implications of our study, it is appropriate to consider its limitations. First, we relied on a survey-based approach and did not collect actual bidding data. This means that our measures are subjective and open to potential recall bias. To minimise the risk of recall bias, we asked participants to recall an online auction that they had participated in within the last month and to complete the survey based on that auction experience. One beneﬁt of our approach is that we were able to gather data in an unobtrusive manner that did not risk interfering with the decisionmaking of the participants as they engaged in the auction process (Todd & Benbast, 1987). Second, we used a single-item measure for our dependent variable that cannot be assessed for reliability. Although we suggest that the use of a single-item measure is justiﬁed in this context due to the unidimensional nature of our focal construct, future research should be conducted with a multi-item measure that can be assessed for reliability to test the robustness of our ﬁndings. Third, although we employed automatic thinking as a meta-theoretic perspective to guide our research, we did not gather the kinds of physical measurements (e.g. functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)) that would allow us to conﬁrm the proposed mechanism and the brain activity associated with it. Additional research is needed in order to conﬁrm the underlying mechanism posited here and to probe other factors (both cognitive and emotional) that may also promote or impede winner’s regret. In spite of the aforementioned limitations, we believe that our work has important implications for both research and practice.\n",

Speciﬁcally, we provide empirical evidence that both trait impulsiveness and sunk cost inﬂuence winner’s regret. Further, we show that competition intensity has a moderating role on these relationships. Speciﬁcally, trait impulsiveness has a greater impact on winner’s regret when the level of competition is high, whereas sunk cost has a greater impact on winner’s regret when competition intensity is low. These ﬁndings indicate that the impact of trait impulsiveness as well as sunk cost on winner’s regret differs depending on the level of competition intensity. Our ﬁndings also have practical implications for online auction participants as well as auction site operators. From the perspective of both online auction participants as well as online auction providers, it is important to know that there can be negative repercussions (i.e. winner’s regret) that result from both the time and the energy that an individual invests in an auction as well as the degree of impulsiveness that an individual brings to the auction. For online auction participants, minimising winner’s regret requires getting in the habit of honouring one’s initial reservation price and resisting the temptation to obsessively check the status of the auction and to incrementally increase one’s bidding limit when one is outbid. Auction participants should be especially wary about falling into a trap that will lead to winner’s regret when competition intensity is high. Under these conditions, participants need to be very careful not to succumb to their own impulsiveness even if it means losing the auction. For auction site operators, our ﬁndings create the possibility of predicting which individuals will be more likely to experience winner’s regret. Speciﬁcally, auction site users could be given a survey prior to participating in online auctions to determine their trait impulsiveness and susceptibility to the sunk cost effect. The results could be used to gauge how likely it is that individuals will experience winner’s regret and auction site users could be warned beforehand. In cases where the risk of winner’s regret is high, the auction site could even recommend that individuals use the ‘buy it now’ feature instead of online bidding. Our research also provides a tool for online auction sites to survey online auction winners to determine the extent to which they experienced winner’s regret. This can be an informative diagnostic tool for helping auction sites to gauge whether winner’s regret is experienced by a handful of users or whether it is something that is experienced more broadly. Once this is known, site management can determine whether any corrective action is needed.\n",

            "rawing on the rational addiction framework, this study explores the digital vulnerabilities driven by dependence on mobile social apps (e.g., social network sites and social games). Rational addicts anticipate the future consequences of their current behaviors and attempt to maximize utility from their intertemporal consumption choices. Conversely, myopic addicts tend toward immediate gratiﬁcation and fail to fully recognize the future consequences of their current consumption. In lieu of conducting self-report surveys or aggregatelevel demand estimation, this research examines addictive behaviors on the basis of consumption quantity at an individual level. To empirically validate rational addiction in the context of social app consumption, we collect and analyze 13-month, individual-level panel data on the weekly app usage of thousands of smartphone users. Results indicate that the average social app user conducts herself in a forward-looking manner and rationally adjusts consumption over time to derive optimal utility. The subgroup analysis, however, indicates that substantial variations in addictiveness and forward-looking propensities exist across demographically diverse groups. For example, addictive behaviors toward social network sites are more myopic in nature among older, less-educated, high-income groups. Additionally, the type of social app moderates the effects of demographic characteristics on the nature of addictive behaviors. We provide implications that policymakers can use to effectively manage mobile addiction problems, with the recommendations focusing on asymmetric social policies (e.g., information- and capacity-enhancing measures).

            "Social applications (“apps”) on mobile platforms shift how we communicate, socialize, learn, and play. Social network sites (SNSs) and platform-based social games—arguably, the two most dominant forms of social apps—progressively integrate into users’ everyday lives. The global number of SNS users is now 2 billion, nearly 30% of the entire world population today (Kemp 2015). Mobile platforms are ubiquitous; as a result, at least 1.6 billion users maintain an active social media presence (as of January 2015). Social games (e.g., Candy Crush, Anipang), which enable social interaction among players through exchanging points, gifting, and competing via leaderboards, have rapidly become prevalent digital pastimes for mobile users (Fields 2014). To illustrate the formidability of social games as competitors in the digital industry,\n",

            "Candy Crush achieved an audience reach of 100 million in a little over a year—an accomplishment that Facebook realized in ﬁve years (Gould 2015). This feat positions the social game parallel to Twitter, with Candy Crush earning nearly double the revenue that the microblogging platform generated during the last quarter of 2014. Yet, the burgeoning popularity of social apps as catalysts for interpersonal connection is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, social apps promote social relationships and assert solidarity with friends. The portability, convenience, and on-demand accessibility offered by mobile devices make perpetual contact possible; users maintain a constant sense of camaraderie and kinship with the people in their social circles by sharing daily routines or playing games. This new social paradigm has consequently reshaped and, to a\n",

            "\f920 certain extent, enriched the social fabric and conventions of society. On the other hand, the social fever engendered by these mobile apps could turn into social fear. Medical professionals and scholars are increasingly concerned that overdependence on social apps can give rise to feelings of social inadequacy and consequently exert adverse ramiﬁcations on human behaviors. Heavy or excessive use of social networks and gaming apps on smartphones fosters habits that can easily develop into addictive conduct, similar to the potential escalation of experimentation to dependence on alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs. A study by Zhang (2014) shows that the average user devoted 2.53 hours daily to social platforms: 1.72 and 0.81 hours to social media sites (e.g., Facebook) and microblogging sites (e.g., Twitter), respectively (Bennet 2015). People compulsively check their SNS feeds—while eating, attending meetings, crossing the street, or driving—for fear of missing a satisfying “social update” (Hedges 2014). Some even interrupt their sleep to keep pace with the unfolding of digital life events. A similar addictive behavior is exhibited by Candy Crush’s 93 million users, who play the game at an average of more than 10 times every day (Makuch 2014). Medical professionals periodically alert the public to the potential of heavy SNS or game dependence to cause health crises, including depression, bipolar disorder, and histrionic personality disorder (Moreno et al. 2011). As the mobile era evolves, the apparent addictive preoccupation with and digital vulnerabilities to SNSs and social games have become vexing social challenges. In academic circles, the debate regarding addictive behaviors continues to intrigue scholars. Numerous researchers and scientists espouse an exclusive deﬁnition of addiction as an acute irrational behavior and as a chronic disease that necessitates psychological and medical treatment. Much of the scholarship maintains that the basic economic principles, such as the imposition of high prices, are ineffective bases in devising a cure for addictive behaviors (Chaloupka 1988). This perspective is challenged by Becker and Murphy (1988), who argue that addiction to substances (e.g., cigarettes and alcohol) can also be explained by utilitymaximizing rational human behavior that can be controlled by exogenous factors (e.g., price adjustments). This reasoning is the essence of rational addiction theory (Becker and Murphy 1988), which holds that addicts are rational in that anticipated future consequences of current consumption inspire sensible conduct intended to help these individuals arrive at a choice characterized by maximum lifetime utility. When addicts expect the future prices of addictive goods to rise, for example, they reduce their current consumption of these goods because the increase diminishes the marginal utility of current and future\n",

            "consumption. This frame of reference starkly contrasts with “myopic” addiction theory, in which one’s current assessment of utility depends solely on the past and current consumption of addictive goods (Pollak 1970, 1976). Although myopic addicts recognize that their past consumption heavily inﬂuences their current consumption decisions because of an accumulated stock of substances (i.e., reinforcement effects), they disregard the consequences of past and current choices on future consumption decisions when availing of current consumption options. These “short-sighted” individuals are predisposed toward immediate gratiﬁcation and fail to recognize the future harmful consequences caused by their current consumption of addictive goods (Chaloupka 1991). These qualities translate to a greater risk and higher vulnerability to the detrimental effects of compulsive behavior among past-driven, myopic addicts than among forward-looking rational addicts. With the aforementioned considerations in mind, we explore social “app-diction” (deﬁned as the excessive dependence on social apps) through the lens of rational addiction theory. In this regard, speciﬁc research questions pursued are as follows: On the basis of the rational addiction framework, do “average” SNS or social game addicts exhibit rational or myopic addictive behaviors? Assuming the presence of individual heterogeneity, which demographic groups (classiﬁed by age, gender, education, and income) are more vulnerable to myopic addiction? Do SNSs more signiﬁcantly induce susceptibility to myopic addiction than do social games? Should addiction and vulnerability to social apps be self-regulated or government regulated? What policies will be effective in curbing social app addiction? Building on the theoretical insights offered by Becker and Murphy (1988), this study derives a framework designed to enrich our understanding of rational addiction to social apps. We draw on this rational choice framework to investigate individuals’ addictive behaviors across the various time horizons (i.e., past, present, and future) over which they attempt to maximize lifetime utility from their intertemporal consumption choices. Previous rational addiction studies concentrated on validating whether addiction itself is a rational behavior at the aggregate level. The current research expands such holistic inquiries to occasion a ﬁne-grained understanding of individual addictive behaviors on social apps. The approach embraced in this work contributes to developing nuanced knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms and dynamics that underlie the digital addiction driven by social apps. To empirically test the presence of addiction among social app users, we collected and analyzed 13-month,\n",

A deﬁciency worth looking into, nonetheless, is that most scholarly works on addiction extensively focus on physical substances (e.g., drugs (Everitt and Robins 2005), cigarettes (Naqvi et al. 2007), or alcohol (Herz 1997)). Minimal attention has been devoted to mobile addiction—a case of being “caught in the Net,” unable to rein in the compulsive use of social apps. 2.1. Internet and Social App Addiction The extant literature on information technology (IT)triggered addiction focuses primarily on the antecedents and consequences of digital addiction. Internet addiction poses as much of a detriment as does substance addiction because it can throw one’s life out of balance and cause physical damage (Young 1998). This survey-driven study reveals that Internet addicts suffer from social, professional, and affective impairment and disruption. Addiction researchers often employ mass communication theory (e.g., Morris and Ogan 1996) to establish a conceptual foundation for elucidating Internet addiction, with the frameworks reﬂecting the social and psychological origins of human needs. Internet addiction can also be deﬁned and understood in terms of the behavioral core elements (i.e., salience, mood modiﬁcation, tolerance, withdrawal, conﬂict, and relapse) that form addiction (Grifﬁths 2000). Selfcontrol is negatively related to online game addiction, whereas aggression and narcissistic identity are positively associated with it (Kim et al. 2008). Notwithstanding the scholarly scrutiny dedicated to Internet addiction, the literature has paid little attention to the issues of addiction to SNSs or social games. An emerging body of work has recently called for a new understanding of the mechanisms and causes, as well as an innovative treatment, of addiction to IT-based social applications. Similar to substance abusers, SNS addicts are vulnerable to many adverse biopsychological consequences, including mood modiﬁcation, salience, tolerance, withdrawal, conﬂict, and relapse (Grifﬁths 2005). Some of the signiﬁcant correlates that predict the tendency toward SNS addiction are self-identity and a desire for belongingness (Pelling and White 2009), social activities and relationship building (Kim et al. 2009), and dysfunctional coping (Kuss and Grifﬁths 2011), such as escapism and avoidance. Regulated use of SNSs and relapse prevention derived from effective deterrence schemes formulated with cognitive-behavioral therapies can successfully inhibit SNS dependence (Echeburúa and de Corral 2010). Although addiction to online or video games, particularly among teenagers, has gained increasing recognition as a viable object to study (see Ng and\n",

To date, most scholarly works on addiction are based on either self-report surveys or demand estimation at the aggregate level. The susceptibility of these methods to structural biases and inaccuracies casts doubt on their cogency and usefulness (Fowler 1992). The survey-based approach reﬂects only user perceptions and not actual behaviors. Similarly, aggregate-level demand estimation pays limited attention to the individual differences in addictive propensities among users and contemplates purchase quantity rather than actual consumption. Precisely quantifying the extent of consumption among smokers and drinkers would be extremely difﬁcult, if not impossible. We improved the quality of consumption measurement by tracing individual real app consumption, which was determined in seconds over a 13-month period. This study is among the ﬁrst to examine addictive behaviors on the basis of individuals’ actual consumption quantities. Our analysis suggests that average users of SNSs or social games exhibit rational addictive behaviors when using the social apps. This ﬁnding theoretically and empirically illuminates numerous conundrums as to why legal sanctions may inefﬁciently curb digital addiction. We also found that addiction vulnerability is associated with the extent of consumption inertia manifested through reinforcement effects, the sensitivity to social liquidity (i.e., network effects), and the degree of propensity for a forward-looking mindset. The interpretation of these results, however, should be tempered by the signiﬁcant variations observed across diverse demographic groups with respect to the nature of addictive behaviors. Certain sociodemographic groups exhibit rational addiction behaviors, whereas others fall prey to myopic addiction. Moreover, these group differences are relativized by app characteristics; the extent of myopic addiction is more pronounced among users of social networking apps than among users of social game apps. Our ﬁndings collectively suggest that addiction to social apps is driven by many factors, but we also derive evidence that effectively addressing these addiction issues is feasible through the adoption of basic economic principles.\n",

Psychological factors, including loneliness, perceived gratiﬁcation, and self-control, are signiﬁcantly associated with social game addiction (Chen and Leung 2015). Computational difﬁculties behind the simple play (Walsh 2014) and network externalities and gratiﬁcations inherent in social games (Wei and Lu 2014) are also identiﬁed as key factors contributing to addiction. A few studies have examined the addictive potential of SNSs on the basis of demographic or personal characteristics. Research (e.g., Correa et al. 2010) indicates that adolescent users with narcissistic traits are more vulnerable to SNS addiction than are adult users. The same study reveals that addiction to SNSs is more pronounced among men with neurotic traits than among women with the same qualities. No signiﬁcant gender difference was detected for addiction to social games, but occupation was found to be signiﬁcantly associated with addictive tendencies (Chen and Leung 2015). Interestingly, both extroverts and introverts develop a penchant for SNS engagement, but for different reasons; while the former are prone to SNS addiction because of the social enhancement factor, the latter’s predilections are stimulated by the need for social compensation (Amichai-Hamburger and Vinitzky 2010). Although varied in scope and context, most addiction studies on SNSs or social games, including all of the works discussed here, focus exclusively on surveybased approaches that must depend on subjective, perceptual, and often inaccurate human cognition (Fowler 1992). The majority of such investigations are also grounded in behavioral theories involving cognitive psychology. Furthermore, medical and psychological studies on SNS or social game addiction all have, as their basis, a type of “disease model,” in which compulsive and irrational behaviors are viewed as originating neurological, genetic, and biological causes that are curable only by lifelong abstinence. The present study relies on an economics framework and uses real consumption data to provide a fresh and unique insight into addiction to social apps. 2.2. A Rational Choice View of Addiction The deﬁning features of addictive behaviors, such as irrationality, compulsion, overindulgence, and loss of control, have been questioned by Becker and Murphy (1988). Using the ﬁndings of Stigler and Becker (1977) and Iannaccone (1984) as a prelude to their analytical derivation, Becker and Murphy (1988) proposed the rational addiction model in which addicts are not “myopic” but rational.

            "behaviors and act prudently in their own best interests to maximize discounted utility. The most essential aspect of the theory is that, by weighing the effects of their actions on the future, addicts, who have full knowledge of the consequences of their addiction, strategically calculate the expected beneﬁts (e.g., utility gains from taking drugs) against costs (e.g., negative impacts on health). They arrive at a rational choice that maximizes lifetime utility based on their stable preferences. For example, drug addicts may be cognizant that their current drug use will stimulate greater future drug consumption and that continued drug use will result in negative consequences (e.g., adverse health). Nevertheless, they may appraise the utility gained from taking drugs as outweighing the discounted reduction in utility arising from negative consequences. Using this example and many others, Becker and Murphy (1988) construe addiction as rational, utility-maximizing behavior, just like any other actions based on economic considerations. To illustrate further, in previous myopic models of addictive behaviors, addicts neither consider the future consequences of their current consumption nor factor future prices of addictive goods into their current consumption decision making (Becker and Murphy 1988). Instead, they choose current consumption based primarily on past consumption. This myopic perspective regards addiction as merely the positive interaction and complementarity between past and current consumption of addictive goods, without reference to future consumption or external factors (e.g., prices). As opposed to this backward-looking, myopic model, the rational addiction framework maintains that addicts decide on current consumption with future consumption and utility in mind to maximize discounted utility. This forward-looking paradigm, which falls under the umbrella of the rational choice model (Calvert 1985), centers on the dynamics of current consumption in response to anticipated future prices of addictive goods. For example, rational addicts may proactively reduce their current consumption of tobacco when they anticipate that prices will rise in the future. They recognize that the anticipated price increase will lower the marginal utility of their current and future consumption. By contrast, myopic addicts do not cut their current consumption in response to expected increases in future prices. In constructing the rational addiction model, Becker and Murphy (1988) assume that an individual’s utility at time t depends on three elements: consumption of addictive goods, Ct ; addictive stock, At ; and consumption of other goods, Yt . In addition, these authors explicate three distinctive aspects of addiction: withdrawal, reinforcement, and tolerance. Withdrawal corresponds to a decline in current utility due\n",

The positive effect of past consumption on current consumption 1 signiﬁes addiction, and the addictive behavior is considered rational when the effect of future consumption on current consumption ( 2 ) exhibits the same direction as 1 . Most empirical studies ﬁnd signiﬁcant and positive values for 1 and 2 in diverse habit-forming contexts, including consumption of cigarettes (Becker et al. 1994), alcohol (Baltagi and Grifﬁn 2002), cocaine (Grossman and Chaloupka 1998), opium (Liu et al. 1999), caffeine (Olekalns and Bardsley 1996), and gambling (Mobilia 1993).\n",

            "to reduced current consumption. Reinforcement is evident when past consumption prompts the desire for current consumption and increase the marginal utility of current consumption. Finally, increased tolerance shows that the greater the addictive stock (i.e., cumulative past consumption of the addictive substance), the lower the current utility (Becker and Murphy 1988). The idiosyncrasies of addiction give rise to a behavioral pattern in which past consumption of addictive goods induces current consumption by inﬂuencing the marginal utility of both current and future consumption (Becker and Murphy 1988). This intertemporal, dependent demand structure, often called adjacent complementarity (Ryder and Heal 1973), epitomizes the key conceptual building blocks that underlie the rational addiction model. Consumers become addicted if their past consumption positively affects their current consumption. An addictive behavior is thought to be rational when current consumption is positively dependent on future utility and consumption. In a subsequent study, Becker et al. (1994) scrutinize the model of rational addiction by conducting an empirical investigation of the effect of higher future cigarette prices on current consumption of cigarettes. In their empirical framework, they assume that addicts make rational decisions about their consumption of both nonaddictive and addictive goods within their lifetime budget. The model assumes a quadratic utility function in Ct At , and Yt to elicit the demand function (for derivations, see Becker et al. 1994, p. 398). Finally, they identify the resulting demand structure of addictive goods, Ct , which denotes current consumption as a function of both past and future consumption, and the current price of the addictive goods, Pt Ct =\n",

            "This study extends the model of rational addiction (Becker and Murphy 1988) to investigate whether addiction to social apps (e.g., SNSs and social games) follows the patterns of utility-maximizing, rational behaviors. Addiction to social apps can be viewed as one form of technological addiction (Turel et al. 2011). We reﬁne the analytical and empirical components of the frameworks architected by Becker and Murphy (1988) and Becker et al. (1994) in the context of mobile social apps, which are nonphysical and monetary-free commodities. We test the models on panel data gathered weekly, examining app consumption behaviors at the individual user level. This approach is in contrast to those of previous studies in which aggregate-level and yearly or quarterly data were used. 3.1. Social Exchanges as Economic Actions Social exchange theory (Homans 1958), which originates from the scientiﬁc traditions of neoclassical economics paradigms, offers a conceptual foundation for comprehending social relationships through economic principles. This canonical theory maintains that social behaviors can be construed as the upshot of negotiated exchange processes, in which rational actors navigating in social situations select behaviors that maximize their own self-interests. If the reward or utility derived from social interaction outweighs the punishment or cost, they cultivate the ensuing relationship. Under an excessively high cost, however, they suspend interpersonal associations. Regarded as an economic metaphor for social relationships, social exchange theory is underpinned by several key premises. First, individuals engaging in social relationships can rationally and successfully gauge the costs and beneﬁts\n",
            "\n",
            "\f924 of social exchanges. Second, individuals involved in exchange processes rationally seek to maximize payoffs or rewards to satisfy their basic social needs. Finally, exchange processes and outcomes alter power and privilege structures in social groups because of the competitive nature of social systems. In our model, the act of consuming social apps (e.g., exchanging messages through SNSs or playing social games) is viewed as an enacted exchange process, in which app users endeavor to maximize payoffs by enhancing their social presence and privileges within the time frame in which the interaction takes place. Users of social apps are forward-looking and rational in that they anticipate the future consequences of their current app consumption. Their social exchange relationships are determined by strategic reward–cost calculations. Consistent with the notion of adjacent complementarity, the current consumption of social apps increases the marginal utility of future consumption; as a result, users increase their current app consumption when they expect social liquidity1 to rise in the future. Users consuming social apps are therefore typiﬁed with a drive to form and maintain stable social bonds and attachments, which are reinforced through the use of such apps. 3.2. Social Liquidity and Exchange Dynamics In Becker and Murphy’s (1988) model, the price of addictive substances regulates addicts’ intertemporal consumption preferences; that is, the anticipated future prices of addictive commodities inﬂuence current consumption because they affect future stocks and consumption patterns. As indicated in the model, governments, for example, can motivate smokers to lessen their current cigarette consumption by preannouncing a cigarette tax increase. In this scenario, increased future prices negatively affect current consumption because future consumption and utility may decrease. Becker et al. (1994) ﬁnd that a 10% increase in cigarette prices can reduce current consumption by as much as 7.5% in the long run. Moreover, as a consequence of the preannouncement a 10% price increase in one period reduces consumption in the previous period by 0.6% and in the subsequent period by 1.5%. These correlation patterns demonstrate the intertemporal associations in cigarette demand that result from rational addictive behaviors. For addicts of mobile social apps, no direct payment is necessary to consume the apps once they have been downloaded and installed onto mobile devices. In fact, mobile apps can be distinguished from physical addictive goods (e.g., cigarettes and alcohol) in several ways. Most mobile apps are available free of charge, but most physical addictive goods are not. In addition, while\n",

Moreover, mobile apps can be downloaded and consumed by anyone, anywhere, whereas physical addictive goods, like cigarettes, can be purchased and consumed only by adult consumers in speciﬁc areas. Finally, interaction and reciprocity stimulate the consumption of social mobile apps, such as SNSs and social games, but such social intercourse, although relevant, is less important in the consumption of physical addictive products. Just as price affects the consumption of physical commodities, social liquidity (i.e., the ease with which one can establish interpersonal relationships) determines how much users consume the social commodities (e.g., social apps). In ﬁnancial markets, market liquidity, deﬁned as how easily an asset can be traded and converted to cash with minimal impact on price, often has a signiﬁcant effect on traders’ willingness to engage in trading activities. If all else is equal, the greater the liquidity within a market, the larger the beneﬁts investors can gain. The size of the market (e.g., the number of active traders) often serves as a key catalyst that galvanizes the degree of market liquidity (Pagano 1989). Furthermore, because of the network externality effect, the principle of liquidity attracts liquidity is often demonstrated in the ﬁnancial market (Roll et al. 2009). In this respect, utility from consuming social apps for users is contingent on the amount of social liquidity they perceive to be available. This is similar to the notion of network effects (Katz and Shapiro 1985) in which a user’s utility derived from consuming a particular social app escalates exponentially as the number of people using it increases. Recently, several studies focusing on onlinebased social networks (e.g., Susarla et al. 2012, Zeng and Wei 2013) demonstrated the important role such positive consumption externalities play in disseminating user-generated content across social network platforms (e.g., YouTube and Flickr). Consequently, rational, forward-looking app users form expectations about changes in social liquidity in future periods and establish optimal consumption plans that maximize their discounted utility in the present. Following the lead of Freud et al. (1930) in his research on social dynamics, theorists regard the need to belong and social attachment as intrinsic human motivators (Baumeister and Leary 1995). In certain respects, social platforms (e.g., Facebook) can be viewed as social markets where individuals seek and reﬁne social attachments by “trading” (i.e., making or breaking) interpersonal relationships. Relationships may be newly formed, strengthened, and often ended on Facebook and in social games. In essence, several\n",

            "features unique to these platforms, such as Facebook “likes” and in-app currency/credit exchanges, are designed to increase social liquidity. These artifacts foster and lubricate social exchanges through shared emotions, thoughts, and gossip. Users consume social apps to form or maintain lasting, positive, and affectively pleasant relationships with other people within or across their usual social boundaries (Ellison et al. 2007, Steinﬁeld et al. 2008). Furthermore, they often endeavor to enhance their social presence and authority by receiving recognition and soliciting caring comments from others. The more users involved and the greater the social liquidity within a platform, the higher the utility derived from the exchanges. As a consequence, social liquidity (i.e., the number of users available with whom social relationships can be cultivated) inﬂuences how actively individuals engage in online social activities (Fang et al. 2013). Social liquidity also affects their ability to utilize their time resources efﬁciently for the purpose of forming and maintaining interpersonal relationships. Therefore, rational app addicts will anticipatorily increase their current consumption of social apps when they expect future social liquidity to increase. They appraise the utility gained from consuming social apps as outweighing the discounted reduction in utility arising from the negative consequences of doing so (e.g., escapism, procrastination, preoccupation, poor time management). 3.3.

According to Becker and Murphy (1988, p. 682), individuals with a greater preference for the present consumption are more likely to become addicted and behave myopically than those with a greater preference for the future. Thus, the ratio of the estimated coefﬁcients on past consumption to those on future consumption, 1 / 2 , implies the rate of time preference. As r = 1 / 2 − 1, the estimated interest rate captures the rate of time preference.\n",

In addition, we discuss how we identiﬁed the estimates of the parameters, after which we present our ﬁndings. 4.1. Empirical Context and Data Description We constructed a panel data set consisting of information on app time use for two mobile social apps—a widely used social networking app (Facebook) and a popular social gaming app (Anipang). Facebook is a major SNS through which people build and maintain relationships. For example, users may become Facebook friends, sharing their thoughts, opinions, photos, videos, and links to other sites they ﬁnd interesting. Anipang is a platform-based, social puzzle game. The mobile messaging platform allows users to ﬁnd friends who are also playing the puzzle game. The basic structure of Anipang is similar to another popular social puzzle game—Candy Crush. After completing a round, players can check their ranking compared to those of their friends in a social messaging app with a leaderboard for those who play the game. Each game only lasts for one minute. To continue the game, players must acquire in-app currency in the form of “hearts.” Players may choose to wait several minutes to get more hearts. Alternatively, players give each other hearts as gifts or get more hearts by inviting friends on the social messaging app list to join the\n",

The data used in this study were provided by Nielsen Koreanclick, the Korean division of the global market research company specializing in online and mobile Internet audience measurement. Audience measurement measures how many people are in an audience and how long they remain, usually in relation to television viewership (e.g., Nielsen ratings) or trafﬁc on websites and mobile apps. Nielsen Koreanclick maintains a panel of mobile app users, ranging in age from 7 to 69 years old, who are selected by stratiﬁed random sampling. After individuals agree to be panel members, they download and install a Nielsen Mobile App on their mobile devices. This app runs in the background and collects data on panel members’ use of mobile apps and the mobile websites even while disconnected. The meter app regularly transmits encrypted log ﬁles to a server via a secure cellular connection or Wi-Fi. We used data collected between October 1, 2012, and October 27, 2013 (56 weeks). The data for panel members included individual-level weekly information on these users’ activities on the aforementioned social apps throughout the sampling period. In addition, we acquired individual-level information on user demographics such as age, gender, income, and education. 4.2.

Use of the rational addiction model in the context of mobile social apps poses several endogeneity problems due to the presence of lead and lag with respect to the dependent variable, the potential simultaneity between the number of active users and the dependent variable, and a potential serial correlation among the disturbances. To address these issues, we adopt Blundell and Bond’s (1998) system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator which uses the lagged differences of endogenous variables as instruments for the model in levels, in addition to the lagged levels of endogenous variables as instruments for the model in ﬁrst differences. The system GMM estimator is considered more robust than difference GMM because the former combines the moment conditions for the model\n",

            "in ﬁrst differences with the moment conditions for the model in levels, whereas the latter focuses solely on the ﬁrst set of conditions (Blundell et al. 2001).2 By contrast to typical models that use dynamic panel data (e.g., Arellano and Bond 1991), our model includes not only Ci t−1 but also Ci t+1 as endogenous exploratory variables. This feature prevents us from employing typical two-period lagged variables (e.g., Ci t−2 as instruments for endogenous variables because Ci t−2 is a direct function of Ci t−1 , which itself is an endogenous variable. Given this situation, we used higher lagged variables Ci t−3 Ci t−k and Li t−3 Li t−k as instruments for the model in ﬁrst differences and Ci t−2 and Li t−2 as instruments for the model in levels. To determine whether this set of instruments is valid for use with our data and satisﬁes the requirements necessary for analyzing panel data, we performed the Hansen test for the overidentiﬁcation of instruments. We also carried out the difference-inHansen test of instrument exogeneity, which includes not only the lagged levels of endogenous variables (i.e., instruments for difference GMM) but also the lagged differences of endogenous variables (i.e., additional instruments for system GMM). The results conﬁrm the validity of our instruments (10% signiﬁcance level). Additionally, we conducted auto-regression (AR) tests for the autocorrelation of the residuals to ensure the appropriateness of our lagged endogenous variables. By construction, the residuals of the differenced Equation (5) should exhibit serial correlation because of the lead and lag of the dependent variable; that is, we should reject Arellano–Bond (Arellano and Bond 1991) tests for AR(1) and AR(2). However, if the assumption of serial independence in the original errors is warranted, the differenced residuals should not exhibit signiﬁcant AR(3) behavior. Our results are consistent with our expectations in that they allow for the rejection of the Arellano–Bond test for AR(1) and AR(2) but not for AR(3) at the 5% signiﬁcance level. This set of instruments is thus deemed suitable for use with the panel data. 4.3. Main Results Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the variables included in the analysis. The average user in our sample spent 3,039 and 4,889 seconds (or 51 and 81 minutes, respectively) per week on the SNS and social game, respectively.

For example, the ﬁrst column (i.e., Facebook) shows that the interest rate is positive (0.214) due to the larger coefﬁcient of past consumption (0.244) than the coefﬁcient of future consumption (0.201). Similarly, in the second column (i.e., Anipang), the coefﬁcient of past consumption (0.275) is larger in magnitude than the coefﬁcient of future consumption (0.252); thus, the interest rate is positive (0.09).

            "\f928 as social liquidity grows, rational app addicts increase their consumption of social apps. For example, SNS apps allow people to communicate with each other socially. They can exchange messages and receive automatic notiﬁcation when their friends update their proﬁles. They can also regulate their app consumption according to the number of active users on the platform. In the context of social game apps, leader scoreboards help users learn about and predict the usage patterns of their friends more accurately and manage their intertemporal consumption wisely. Furthermore, players often invite their friends to be able to play more. Such incentives built into social games can also make players regulate their consumption rationally. Drawing on the insights provided by Becker et al. (1994), we identify three types of elasticity related to intertemporal liquidity to quantify how changes in the past, current, and future social liquidity may affect the volume of current consumption. Figure 2 presents a schematic representation that visualizes the effects of changes in liquidity in period = 20 on app consumption in period ± t t ≥ 0 with respect to the two types of social apps. Speciﬁcally, Figure 2 displays percentage increases in app consumption in period t in response to a 1% increase in liquidity in period t = 0. To illustrate further, t = 0 denotes the effects of changes in current liquidity on current consumption. While t = −5 denotes the extent to which changes in future liquidity ﬁve weeks after the current period t = 0 affect current consumption t = −5 , t = 5 indicates how variations in past liquidity ﬁve weeks prior to the current period t = 0 inﬂuenced the volume of current consumption t=5 . Figure 2 portrays several noteworthy empirical regularities surrounding the differential effects of social liquidity on use of the two types of social apps. Users of SNS are more sensitive to changes in social liquidity than users of social games. In addition, users of both apps become most responsive to the current liquidity change. Furthermore, as opposed to social game\n",

Subsample Analyses Addictive behaviors may vary based on demographic factors and user characteristics (Chaloupka 1991). Social inﬂuence and latent homophily have been found to signiﬁcantly affect the behaviors of online users (Ma et al. 2014). To account for the varying degrees of addiction to mobile social apps according to user-related factors (e.g., age, gender, education, and income), we performed estimations using separate demand equations for different user groups. Speciﬁcally, we divided the sample into two subsamples according to age (7–29 years old and 30–69 years old) and gender (male and female), two different subsamples according to education (high school graduates and university graduates), and two more subsamples according to income (≤ $3,000/month and > $3,000/month).3 Our subgroup analysis indicates that substantial addictiveness and rationality (time preferences) variations exist across groups of diverse demographic characteristics (Table 3). In the case of the SNS (panel 1), older users exhibit only myopic usage patterns and no rational addiction behaviors ( ˆ 2 , p > 0 05). Given their expanded social circle, older users are likely to exhibit more relational diversity and complexity than younger users (Antonucci and Akiyama 1987). The latter maintains relatively more homogeneous relationships because their social circle is narrower and thinner (e.g., schools) than that of older users (Morris et al. 2004). Diverse and complex social ties may cause older users to experience more difﬁculty in exercising forwardlooking relational management than that encountered by their younger counterparts (Baumeister et al. 1998). A similar pattern was observed among users with less education. Higher-income groups do not exhibit rational addiction behaviors and are characterized as myopic addicts. The ﬁndings on social games align with expectations (panel 2); that is, younger groups exhibit signiﬁcant myopic addiction propensities. In addition to myopic addiction, rational addiction is more pronounced in some groups than others. On the basis of the procedures recommended by Clogg et al. (1995), we carried out a formal statistical test to conﬁrm whether signiﬁcant differences exist across various demographic groups in terms of the degree of\n",

            "4.5.3. Forward-Looking Behavior. Most empirical research on rational addiction relies on the assumption that individuals can forecast future prices accurately. This assumption has been criticized because very few price increases are announced a year in advance (Gruber and K˝ oszegi 2001). To redress this oversight, Gruber and K˝ oszegi (2001) suggested an alternative mechanism for testing forward-looking behaviors using monthly cigarette consumption data. They found that tax increases that are yet to be implemented lead to decreased consumption of cigarettes in the present, which is evidence of forward-looking behaviors. In keeping with Gruber and Köszegi’s (2001) approach, we test whether users of social apps exhibit forward-looking behaviors.

This alternative measurement scheme for the liquidity construct ensures that our results remain robust under the assumption of homophilious behaviors among app users (i.e., users react more positively to other users with similar traits; McPherson et al. 2001). 4.6. Falsiﬁcation Tests Results Auld and Grootendorst (2004) demonstrated that the rational addiction model tends to yield spurious evidence in favor of the rational addiction hypothesis even for nonaddictive goods, such as milk, eggs, oranges, and apples, especially when aggregate data are used. Note that we do not use aggregate data, but individual user-level data, to estimate the rational addiction model in this study. Nevertheless, to address the issue of the potential spurious relations and disprove alternative explanations (e.g., mobile apps are generally addictive), we conducted falsiﬁcation tests. Speciﬁcally, we considered popular smartphone “utility apps” that are regarded as nonaddictive, such as camera, photo gallery, and address book. If these apps are not germane to rational addiction theory, our results in favor of the rational addiction hypothesis will be further strengthened. Table 8 shows the results of the falsiﬁcation tests. No signiﬁcant impact of future or past consumption is evident (95% conﬁdence level). Apps such as camera, photo gallery, and address book are neither addictive nor rational. Note that the samples used in this falsiﬁcation test are smaller than those used in the main analysis. To alleviate the concern that arises from the difference in sample size, we reduced the main data set into clusters of 8-week periods, which are equivalently sized as the data set used for the falsiﬁcation test. Accordingly, from the 56 weeks of data available in our data set, we extracted 49 combinations of the 8-week long data set (i.e., weeks 1–8, weeks 2–9, weeks 3–10, , and weeks 49–56) and used them to validate the rational addiction model. The estimated coefﬁcients of lagged consumption, Ci t−1 , are significantly positive across all 8-week estimations (100%). In the case of lead consumption Ci t+1 , statistical signiﬁcance was observed for 22 out of the 28 coefﬁcients (79%). These consistent results support our main ﬁndings and demonstrate that the signiﬁcance of the estimated consumption coefﬁcients was not derived by simple correlations of consumptions within extended periods. Consequently, we can successfully reject the falsiﬁcation argument and assert the rigor of our rational addiction framework in this context. We performed an additional veriﬁcation test to distinguish the effects of social apps from those of regular nonsocial apps. We chose the top three nonsocial game apps (Angry Birds, Minecraft, and Temple Run) for the additional falsiﬁcation test. These are standalone game apps that offer minimal or no social\n",

For social games, “Anipang for Sacheonseong,” which is a new game that competes against Anipang, is considered an external event. Table 6 presents the results of Gruber and Köszegi’s (2001) test for forward-looking behavior using these two events. The coefﬁcient of Preannouncet is positive and signiﬁcant for Facebook. Facebook users were found to increase their weekly consumption substantially (i.e., by as much as 461 seconds) when the dominant SNS company preannounced the launch of its Facebook Home app. This ﬁnding provides evidence of forward-looking behaviors, at least for this population. In the case of Anipang, the coefﬁcient of Preannouncet is negative and signiﬁcant. This shows that Anipang users had already reduced their weekly consumption signiﬁcantly (i.e., by as much as 12,337 seconds) when the top social game provider preannounced its future launch of a new competing game. One plausible explanation is that Anipang users forecast that the liquidity of Anipang would decrease when the new competing social game was launched. These results conﬁrm the forward-looking behavior of social app users, which is additional evidence in favor of the rational addiction model. 4.5.4. Alternative Measurement for Liquidity.

            "933 and “cold turkey” consumption patterns among rational addicts. In summary, unlike nonaddicts, rational addicts can experience an unstable steady state in which they become heavily addicted and consume a commodity in large quantities. Furthermore, rational addicts often experience more difﬁculty in overcoming addiction than do myopic addicts. Becker and Murphy (1988) assert that rational addicts may deliberately postpone terminating their addiction as they attempt to ﬁnd ways to optimally minimize short-run loss of utility from abruptly ceasing consumption. For example, rational smoking addicts initially endeavor to stop smoking by experimenting with easier aids (e.g., substituting gum chewing or jogging for smoking) until they ﬁnd the “best” method for quitting smoking with minimal shortterm loss of utility; that is, all factors being equal, rational addicts may suffer from more failures when attempting to terminate addiction given that they are more “fastidious” than myopic addicts in determining an optimal quitting method. This tendency means that rational addicts also remain at risk for adverse conditions. The emerging phenomenon of rational addiction to social apps was scrutinized in an empirical analysis of how individual user characteristics inﬂuence addictive behaviors. Most economics-based rational addiction studies, including Becker et al. (1994), attempt to demonstrate that addiction itself is a rational behavior. Such concentration can be explained by the fact that this stream of research is typically conducted at the aggregate level, without scholars referring to individual heterogeneity in terms of extent of rationality. In other words, these studies focus exclusively on the behaviors of “average” users given their reliance on aggregated, macrolevel consumption data (e.g., annual cigarette sales) that do not quite illuminate the speciﬁc behavioral patterns of individuals. At this level, some users are rational, whereas others are not; some addicts exhibit sounder forward-looking behaviors than do other addicts. Aggregate-level studies aimed at conﬁrming the rationality of addiction may only provide a partial insight into individual variations. Our individual-level and comprehensive panel data enabled us to determine that individuals with varying sociodemographic characteristics differ in their utility maximization trajectories and cost–beneﬁt rationalization over time. Addiction researchers, particularly those who study digital dependency, should therefore use individual-level data to disentangle structural differences in the ability of individuals to exercise selfcontrol and rationally manage their consumption over different time horizons. 5.2.

            "5.1. Implications for Addiction Research The rational addiction framework has been applied in distinct contexts to investigate various addictive behaviors. Most empirical studies have nonetheless been limited to physical commodities, such as alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. Our alterations to and enrichment of the theoretical basis developed by Becker and Murphy (1988) can offer a fresh vantage point from which to study addictive conduct induced by nonphysical, nonmonetary, and highly social commodities. The results derived from the structure of intertemporal consumption demand reveal that individuals become more vulnerable to social app addiction under the following conditions. First, given that positive reinforcement drives the development of an addictive behavior, individuals who are exposed to stronger positive reinforcement and exhibit resilient consumption inertia are more susceptible to social app addiction. Second, the more sensitive an individual is to social liquidity, the greater her vulnerability to social app addiction. More vulnerable addicts will proactively increase their current consumption of apps when they expect future social liquidity or network effects to increase. Third, individuals who heavily discount the exacerbating effects of current consumption on future harmful consequences are more vulnerable to myopic addiction. These addicts tend to appraise the utility gained from consuming social apps as outweighing the discounted reduction in utility arising from adverse consequences. Our ﬁndings lend credence to the notion of rational addiction in the context of mobile social app consumption. Rational addiction to social games and SNSs can be interpreted as an indication that the users of these social goods are in control of their thinking and actions when confronted with consumption decisions. Caution must be used, however, when interpreting these empirical regularities. Rational addiction is still one form of addiction that can result in negative consequences. From a social welfare perspective, nonaddiction should be viewed as more ideal than rational addiction. Being “rational” means attempting to maximize utility over time given constraints and therefore exerts no direct implications for consumption quantity (Becker and Murphy 1988). Becker and Murphy (1988) alert us to the possibility that a small change in environmental factors (e.g., price change) will drive people to drastically change their consumption of addictive goods. They call this condition an unstable steady state and regard it as an important aspect of rational addiction theory. In their study, Becker and Murphy (1988) demonstrate that steady states easily become unstable when goods are highly addictive. According to the authors, the unstable state also explains binge\n",

These social apps may have already become pastimes for adolescents with narcissistic tendencies who, many experts believe, are likely to experience the adverse consequences of the mental escapism, procrastination, preoccupation, and poor time management that often accompany addictive behaviors; suicide may even be one of these ramiﬁcations (Kuss and Grifﬁths 2011). To address the digital addiction issue, government agencies have implemented preventive measures, but thus far only in a regulatory and coercive manner. Korea’s Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism, for example, has been implementing the controversial 2010 law called the “Cinderella law,” which forbids online game providers from offering services to teenagers under 16 between midnight and 6 a.m. Similarly, the Vietnamese government imposes daytime and nighttime curfews, during which access to online games are blocked. The effectiveness of these intimidating directives has been extensively questioned because of their many obvious legal loopholes and evasions. On top of that, regulations and legal controls have achieved only temporary and limited success in curbing addiction (Song 2014). Successful intervention may be less a matter of domination and more an issue of understanding the root and nature of the problem. Why do people deviate from normal, nonaddicted, and prescriptive states and form an unhealthy attachment to substances or services? A simple explanation would be that they are either uninformed about the detrimental consequences of such indulgence or incapable of resisting immediate gratiﬁcation and dependence even with sufﬁcient awareness of potential harm. With this in mind, we offer two mechanisms that could be effective in controlling compulsive behavior and improving public health; that is, addiction to social apps can be mitigated by information-enhancing policies and capacityenhancing policies. The former have been suggested as effective public policies, especially in situations characterized by considerable and persistent heterogeneities among people (Winter 2011). Our ﬁndings show that when consuming social apps, some people are rational and far-sighted, but others are myopic and short-sighted. In addition, degrees of myopia and forward looking, as well as elasticity to social liquidity, statistically vary across groups of diverse demographic characteristics. As articulated earlier, individuals with varying sociodemographic characteristics differ in their utility maximization trajectories and cost–beneﬁt rationalization over time. How do we identify a priori which groups are more vulnerable to myopic addiction and which are more sensitive to social liquidity? Can we capitalize on differences that\n",

            "are predicted on the basis of demographic traits and subsequently design policies that effectively “satisfy” those who need care and those who do not? Many people fall victim to social app addiction because they underestimate its physical and mental health consequences (Lin et al. 2015). Excessive smartphone consumption is signiﬁcantly associated with depression, stress, and sleep disturbance (Thomée et al. 2011). Lin et al. (2015) ﬁnd that the stronger a user’s dependence on a smartphone, the greater their underestimation of adverse health effects. Just as information-enhancing policies successfully curb cigarette addiction (Hammond et al. 2007), they are expected to substantially enhance public awareness of digital addiction hazards, stimulate sustained selfcontrol, and dissuade nonaddicts from compulsive consumption. The effectiveness of these policies lies in the provision of warnings (similar to those on cigarette packages) or the broadcast of documentaries regarding the severity of and vulnerability to a health risk originating from overdependence. Such policies could be useful particularly in curbing social app addiction, which signiﬁcantly varies depending on individual differences. The real strength of information-enhancing policies is that they positively affect addicts who need such information to temper compulsion but do not in any way inﬂuence those already fully informed about the risks of compulsive conduct. This feature means that asymmetric social policies (Winter 2011) cover virtually everyone across the spectrum of social app addiction; that is, no efforts are required to differentiate among social app addicts. Alternatively, capacity-enhancing policies operate under the principle of reinforcing self-disciplinary and rational management abilities. They are a form of management that is particularly suitable for myopic addicts given their limited willpower in sustaining self-regulation. These short-sighted individuals also exhibit consumption preferences that are inconsistent across time (i.e., assigning more weight to current consumption than to future consumption), thereby entangling themselves in a lifestyle of immediate gratiﬁcation and exposing themselves to severe risk. Under capacity enhancement, a user’s ability to exercise selfcontrol and rationally manage intertemporal consumption can be improved through a mechanism: liquidity transparency. Social liquidity plays an important role in the distribution of app consumption across temporal spaces. To reinforce the forward-looking behavior of social app consumers and prevent them from crossing over to myopic addiction, developers or platform providers could design additional usability features that aid users in easily identifying the degree of social liquidity. Social app users may beneﬁt from such signaling addons in that these features help users plan consumption\n",

This ﬁgure is remarkable given that America allocates US$170 billion and US$151 billion annually to ensuring public welfare and health and addressing productivity losses caused by smoking, respectively (Bach 2012). On average, work is disrupted by social media once every 10.5 minutes; workers require 23 minutes to refocus on their tasks. The public image of and attitudes toward social app platforms and developers may rapidly erode as our health, social lives, and economic welfare are severely jeopardized by excessive dependence on SNSs or social games. Platform providers or developers of social apps, particularly game app creators, may be able to enhance their public appeal by pursuing regulation in the form of informationenhancing or capacity-enhancing policies. Although “ethically” oriented marketing campaigns may reduce short-term proﬁts, these initiatives will eventually elevate the quality with which developers/providers respond to negative spillovers caused by people’s compulsive behaviors. In addition, information-enhancing policies may have strategic appeal to app developers and platform providers, resulting in increases rather than decreases in consumption in certain situations. For example, if social app users overestimate the risks of addiction, they are already consuming too little even when a large number of users are available for social interaction. Correcting users’ information deﬁciency could increase their social app consumption (Winter 2011). Consequently, given the high degree of variations among users in risk perceptions toward social app addiction, social app developers and platform providers may be able to increase app consumption from those who were initially misinformed about the risk of such compulsive behaviors through the provision of correct information about the hazard. Our ﬁndings also provide app developers and platform owners with valuable insights into usage patterns for mobile social apps, which starkly contrast with those for nonsocial apps (e.g., utility apps). Moreover, recognizing the wide-ranging variations in addictiveness and rationality across diverse demographic groups can advance the prediction of consumption intensity over time and the establishment of effective advertising and targeting strategies.\n",

            "distribution across social apps, wisely manage usage, and maximize utility. Some social games (e.g., Anipang in Korea), for instance, publish a leader scoreboard, which lists players who earn the highest points among a given circle of friends connected through a platform. To promote social exchange, the scoreboard is constantly updated for a player’s SNS contacts. In addition to scoreboards, usage metrics can be openly disseminated by developers to advise players about how intensively their contacts are participating in a game. Users of social apps exhibit different consumption patterns when new rules are enacted (Claussen et al. 2013). Liquidity posts facilitate the accurate monitoring and prediction of friends’ usage patterns, as well as the sensible management of intertemporal consumption for optimal utility. Making liquidity information publicly available is equally advantageous to app developers and platform providers. Consider Skype’s online status indicator, a feature that allows users to easily identify who is currently available for interaction in their networks. This component reduces the search costs associated with ascertaining availability. The status function also enables users to know how active or inactive friends are over a speciﬁc period (i.e., daytime or weekends). Additionally, the recognition or perception of others’ usage patterns may help users more efﬁciently plan consumption over time. The reduced transaction costs would, in turn, encourage users to more actively and regularly consume (or plan to consume) a service. Implications for Social App Developers and Platform Providers On the surface, social app developers and platform providers have no incentive to embrace regulatory agencies’ efforts to design and implement information-enhancing or capacity-enhancing policies. The reduction in general app consumption targeted by such regulations is viewed as damaging to digital businesses, at least in the short term. Such damage is exempliﬁed by the dilemma confronting industries that produce legalized “sin” products or services (e.g., tobacco, liquor, junk food, and gambling). Because the products are addictive, unhealthy commodities, the companies that manufacture them are facing intense public scrutiny today. Few people would consider SNSs or social games to be as “sinful” as the aforementioned addictive substances, yet research (i.e., Hofmann et al. 2012) reveals that mobile-based SNSs are more addictive and more difﬁcult to resist than cigarettes and alcohol. Parents are increasingly apprehensive about their children’s fascination with SNSs and platform games, which have been known to diminish the quality of family relationships. Another unfavorable effect of addiction to social apps is the economic ramiﬁcations stemming from 5.3.\n",

            "\f936 Furthermore, major SNS sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, differ substantially in terms of value propositions, business scope, and target customers, as well as available socialization features and functionalities. These structural heterogeneities inherent to diverse SNS sites may inﬂuence users’ future orientation and app consumption patterns. Future research should be directed toward determining whether these differences inﬂuence the ﬁndings reported in this study. Although several studies published by major academic journals (e.g., Danaher and Dagger 2013, Ma et al. 2014, Sabnis and Grewal 2015) use Nielsen data collected by similar stratiﬁed sampling procedures, we acknowledge that potential sample self-selection bias may reduce the generalizability of our ﬁndings. We believe the most ideal method is to verify whether people who participated in experiments exhibit the same usage behaviors as those who did not. However, because of conﬁdentiality issues, the company does not make such data available to the public. Like other studies utilizing such data, the current research was unable to formally verify self-selection. One prediction is that unbiased measurement could strengthen our results since users may be curtailing their behavior if they know they are being monitored, and addicted users may be unlikely to select into the monitor. We acknowledge that this issue may be one of the limitations of our work. Another caveat is related to the model speciﬁcation. Consistent with Becker et al. (1994), our model prioritizes parsimony and substantive importance over predictive power and policy counterfactuals. Consequently, we may have omitted several control variables from our speciﬁcations. For example, apart from social liquidity, other factors (e.g., platform type, price, reward systems) may affect social app consumption. Although our model competently explains a large portion of variances in observed consumption regularities, we acknowledge the model’s parsimony as a limitation. Future studies could expand the menu of variables to enhance the model’s richness and comprehensiveness. Furthermore, the reduced-form approaches used to implement our model estimation prevents us from examining alternative policies. Gordon and Sun (2015) recently developed a structural model of addiction and stockpiling to examine cigarette consumption. Future research can beneﬁt from the comprehensive empirical insights that may be revealed by the structural estimation approach. Finally, the mobile paradigm is rapidly altering the dynamics of users’ socialization process and communication protocols.

            "Social apps have been painted as a boon to interpersonal connectivity within or across one’s social boundaries. Yet, the excessive use of and compulsive dependence on such programs have become major social problems around the globe. The beneﬁts acquired from social apps appear to be overshadowed by addiction-related challenges. In illuminating this issue, survey-based inquiries grounded in psychological frameworks are commonplace, but scant attention has been devoted to economics-based empirical works on digital vulnerabilities that are brought forth by addiction to ubiquitous IT artifacts. Drawing on Becker and Murphy’s (1988) rational addiction framework, this study delved into whether the fundamental economic principles of utility maximization and rational behavior direct consumption patterns for highly addictive social apps, such as SNSs and social games. The ﬁndings obtained from comprehensive panel data on weekly app consumption support, at the aggregate level, the propositions of the rational addiction paradigm in relation to the social media context; that is, users of social apps amplify their sensitivity to social liquidity as they build their intertemporal consumption structures and maximize the discount utility derived from them. Note, however, that this aggregated ﬁnding highlights only the behaviors of the average user and does not cover structural differences among individuals. This limitation is compensated by the subgroup analysis, which reveals extensive heterogeneity originating from demography; some users are identiﬁed as myopic addicts, and others are classiﬁed as rational addicts. Additionally, the signiﬁcant variances in the degree of addictiveness and rationality among addicts translate to equally immense differences in exposure to risk and susceptibility to addiction across various demographic groups. The presence of such individual differences prompts the need for asymmetric social policies, namely, information-enhancing and capacityenhancing regulations, which can satisfy the intervention requirements of both addicted and nonaddicted individuals. The advancement and increase in pervasiveness of mobile technology can only be expected to exacerbate the vulnerability to digital addiction posed by SNSs and games—an effect that can potentially take a tremendous toll on public health.

            "t is not enough to get information technology (IT) users to adopt a secure behavior. They must also continue to behave securely. Positive outcomes of secure behavior may encourage the continuance of that behavior, whereas negative outcomes may lead users to adopt less-secure behaviors. For example, in the context of authentication, login success rates may determine whether users continue to use a strong credential or switch to less secure behaviors (e.g., storing a credential or changing to a weaker, albeit easier to successfully enter, credential). Authentication is a particularly interesting security behavior for information systems researchers to study because it is affected by an IT artifact (the design of the user interface). Laptops and desktop computers use full-size physical keyboards. However, users are increasingly adopting mobile devices, which provide either miniature physical keypads or touchscreens for entering authentication credentials. The difference in interface design affects the ease of correctly entering authentication credentials. Thus, the move to use of mobile devices to access systems provides an opportunity to study the effects of the user interface on authentication behaviors. We extend existing process models of secure behaviors to explain what inﬂuences their (dis)continuance. We conduct a longitudinal ﬁeld experiment to test our predictions and ﬁnd that the user interface does affect login success rates. In turn, poor performance (login failures) leads to discontinuance of a secure behavior and the adoption of less-secure behaviors. In summary, we ﬁnd that a process model reveals important insights about how the IT artifact leads people to (dis)continue secure behaviors.

This gap is important because persuading people to adopt a desirable security practice is of limited value if they subsequently discontinue it and revert to less-secure behaviors. Research has shown that initial use decisions are different from decisions to continue using that system (Agarwal and Karahanna 2000, Bhattacherjee 2001, Karahanna et al. 1999, Kim et al. 2007, Taylor and\n",

In particular, actual experience using a system moderates the inﬂuence of intentions and attitudes on subsequent behavior (Hong et al. 2008; Limayem et al. 2007; Venkatesh et al. 2008, 2012). For example, people tend to disable or stop using security features that are inconvenient or difﬁcult to perform (Adams and Sasse 1999). Authentication controls are a critical part of an information security program because their objective is to limit system access to only authorized individuals. Three types of authentication credentials are commonly used: something you know (e.g., a PIN, password, or passphrase), something you have (e.g., a smart card or USB token), or something you are (e.g., biometric identiﬁers such as ﬁngerprints, voice recognition, etc.). Of these three types of credentials,\n",

            "the ﬁrst is ubiquitous. Indeed, in many systems, a user name and a password (or equivalent) is the only authentication credential used. Even when systems require multiple credentials, a practice referred to as multifactor authentication, passwords usually are one of those factors. Thus, password usability remains an important security topic. A well-documented challenge in the use of password-based authentication is the trade-off between security and ease of use (Brown et al. 2004; Huang et al. 2011; Ives et al. 2004; Keith et al. 2007, 2009; Yan et al. 2004; Zviran and Haga 1999). For example, people tend to create passwords that are easy to remember, which often means that they are also easy to guess. The importance of ease of use means that features of the information technology (IT) artifact, such as the nature of the user interface (UI), are likely to be key determinants of the decision to continue a secure authentication behavior. The potential effect of the design and implementation of the UI on secure authentication behavior is particularly relevant in light of the ever-increasing use of mobile devices (e.g., phones, tablets, etc.) to access and store sensitive information in ﬁnancial systems and social networks. Whereas desktop and laptop computers provide full-size physical keyboards for entering authentication credentials, mobile devices possess miniature keyboards or, increasingly, touchscreens, which represent ﬂat facsimiles of a traditional keyboard. These differences in the UI make data entry both slower and more error prone when using mobile devices rather than desktop or laptop computers (Bao et al. 2011, Jakobsson and Akavipat 2012, Lee and Zhai 2009, Park et al. 2008). Consequently, if people experience difﬁculty in entering strong authentication on mobile devices, they may be tempted to discontinue a secure authentication behavior (e.g., the use of a strong authentication credential) and adopt a less-secure, but easier to successfully perform, alternative. For example, they may store the password on their device and conﬁgure it to automatically submit it whenever accessing a remote system. Such behavior seriously weakens authentication security—particularly in light of the millions of reported incidents of mobile device loss or theft each year (ConsumerReports 2014). People also sometimes “loan” their phone to others (Ben-Asher et al. 2011, Karlson et al. 2009). Whether lost, stolen, or loaned, the result is that an unauthorized person has physical possession of the device. Therefore, if the device was conﬁgured to automatically submit authentication credentials, the risk of unauthorized access to systems that contain sensitive information is high. This study makes several important contributions to the security literature. First, we examine the factors that inﬂuence the continuation of secure behaviors. We use the results of psychology research on\n",

            "memory structures and the modiﬁcation of decision strategies to extend existing information systems (IS) process models of security behavior (Liang and Xue 2009). Speciﬁcally, we characterize individuals’ attempts to behave securely as part of a cybernetic loop that inﬂuences subsequent behavior (Carver and Scheier 1982, Wiener 1948). Our second contribution is methodological. Two of the greatest difﬁculties in information privacy and security research are (1) collecting valid measures of real user behaviors and (2) monitoring these behaviors over time (Belanger and Crossler 2011, Smith et al. 2011). We address those problems by designing a longitudinal ﬁeld experiment that allows us to observe people’s authentication behaviors in a natural setting, rather than in a controlled laboratory experiment. This increases the likelihood that the behaviors we observe are representative of those likely to occur in practice. In particular, we investigate how the UI, speciﬁcally the means (touchscreen versus fullsize physical keyboard) used to enter authentication credentials to obtain access to a remote system, affects continuance of authentication behaviors. Our results suggest that despite mechanisms designed to improve the usability of mobile keyboards (e.g., displaying the last character typed), mobile interfaces clearly hinder the continuance of secure authentication behaviors. Consequently, the mobile interface may be the catalyst that ﬁnally shifts—indeed, is currently shifting—the security paradigm away from relying primarily (and in many cases, solely) on textentry-based authentication and toward the use of multifactor approaches that include other types of credentials (e.g., biometrics).\n",

            "Voluntary security behaviors in nonworkplace settings have received increased research attention over the past decade. For example, studies have examined the use of antimalware to protect computers (Dinev and Hu 2007, Johnston and Warkentin 2010, Lee and Larsen 2009, Liang and Xue 2010), the use of ﬁrewalls to control access to home wireless networks (Woon et al. 2005), and intent to engage in protective behaviors to respond to computer security threats in general (Anderson and Agarwal 2010). This stream of research has primarily drawn on protection motivation theory (Rogers 1975, Tanner et al. 1991) to explain how and why people choose to behave securely. Liang and Xue (2009) developed an IS-speciﬁc variant, which they called Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT), designed to speciﬁcally focus on computer security. According to TTAT, secure behaviors represent a coping response to recognized threats. The two most important antecedents\n",

            "of secure behaviors are (1) perceptions that a threat is serious (i.e., has a high likelihood of occurring and results in severe consequences) and (2) perceptions that the threat is avoidable because there exist effective countermeasures that can be performed without excessive cost or effort. This variance model has been validated in a number of studies (e.g., Johnston and Warkentin 2010, Liang and Xue 2010). However, TTAT also includes a process model explaining the continuance of security behaviors that has received signiﬁcantly less attention from researchers. The process model is based on a cybernetic feedback loop (Carver and Scheier 1982). One of the core concepts of cybernetic theory (Wiener 1948) is that human beings constantly adjust their behavior toward an end goal via cybernetic feedback loops (Carver and Scheier 1982). A cybernetic loop consists of a goal, comparator, input function, environmental impacts, and output function (see Figure 1). The cybernetic loop begins when there is a disturbance to either the environment (e.g., the user’s password is cracked) or the goal (e.g., IT manager dictates a stronger password). Consider, for example, that someone has purchased a new mobile device and would like to use it for ﬁnancial transactions such as online banking or investments. However, the ﬁnancial institution likely has a security policy that requires use of an authentication credential that meets certain guidelines. Or, the user voluntarily chooses to create a strong authentication credential. Either way, the result is a new goal: to create and use a strong credential to access the remote system. The user compares their present state (weak or no authentication credential) to their desired state (strong credential). The result of that comparison triggers the output function. The output function represents the behavior intended to eliminate the discrepancy—in this case, the creation of a stronger password. The impact on the environment is that the user’s credential is now more resistant to\n",
            "\n",
            "password guessing and cracking. If the credential is not sufﬁciently strong, the input function senses the noncompliance, compares it to a reference point (comparator), which may be either an internal standard or an explicit requirement embedded in the remote system, and the loop repeats until the goal is achieved. Thus, the task of creating a strong credential can be explained as an iterative process in which the user continually reﬁnes the credential until it becomes satisfactory based on system feedback. However, if there is a disturbance in the environment, the cybernetic loop may continue even after a credential is created. After creating a strong credential, another important factor emerges—the ease of remembering and typing that credential to authenticate to the system. Strong credentials may satisfy the goal of providing more security, yet be difﬁcult to use (Brown et al. 2004; Keith et al. 2007, 2009). If a strong authentication credential results in more failed login attempts, a new goal surfaces: to make the credential more usable. The output function represents the behavior(s) designed to achieve this new goal, including (1) becoming skilled at remembering and typing the credential correctly, (2) changing the credential to something that is still compliant with policy, but easier to use, or (3) storing the credential so that it does not have to be continuously reentered. The latter two coping mechanisms may weaken security. Figure 2 depicts the cybernetic loop of TTAT in a sequential (rather than looped) model (as depicted in Figure 1) beginning with an initial output function behavior and including a subsequent output function. In summary, following the example of TTAT, we adopt the cybernetic feedback loop (Carver and Scheier 1982, Liang and Xue 2009, Wiener 1948) as our core theory to explain the continuance of secure authentication behaviors. We extend that basic model by using relevant reference disciplines to explain steps B through E in Figure 2 in more detail. In\n",

            "particular, we draw on research on memory systems (Ullman 2004) to explain how the user interface inﬂuences (dis)continuance of a secure authentication behavior (step B of Figure 2). We draw from theory on IS continuance and psychology theory concerning the inﬂuence of perceived effort and emotions on decision strategies to explain how user perceptions and reactions to performing the security behavior (step C of Figure 2) inﬂuence the decision to either continue to engage in that behavior or to switch to an alternative designed to bring the user’s existing state and goal state in line (steps D and E of Figure 2). Environmental Impacts: Memory Systems and the User Interface Many security behaviors require both recall of knowledge and skill in applying that knowledge. For example, successful authentication to a system requires both remembering the credential linked to that system and then correctly entering it. Similarly, encrypting sensitive information requires recognizing the need to encrypt something and knowing how to do so. Sometimes the objective is to learn what not to do (e.g., reduce the risk of malware by not clicking on URL links embedded in email) and then practicing such restraint. Research on memory structure, particularly the distinction between declarative and procedural memory (Squire 1986), provides an explanation of how these two components of security behavior tasks (recall and procedures) jointly interact to affect task success. 2.1.1.

            "enumeration attacks. The nature of human memory makes it difﬁcult to satisfy both objectives. New information (e.g., authentication credentials) is initially stored in short-term memory until it can be transferred to long-term memory (Ullman 2004). This process is aided by rehearsal and “chunking” the information held in short-term memory (Baddeley 1994). Chunking refers to the ability to group information together (e.g., letters into words, words into phrases) to aid retention. Meaningful information is easier to remember (Ebbinghaus 1913). Words with speech sounds similar to previously learned words are also easier to store (see the phonological similarity effect; Baddeley 2012), which explains why mnemonic passwords are easier to remember than random ones (Yan et al. 2004). This phenomenon also likely accounts for the widespread use of common words and personal information as passwords (Johansson and Riley 2005). However, “simple” authentication credentials comprised of common words found in dictionaries, such as ﬂuffy or nonetheless, are weak because they are easily guessed or cracked through brute-force enumeration techniques. Credentials that add one or more numbers either before or after a common word, such as 579rhyme or ready123, or that replace letters with symbols, such as p@$$w0rd, are also “simple” because they, too, are weak and easily cracked. Therefore, most organizations have password policies that prohibit the use of common words as part of an authentication credential and instead require users to create credentials that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Credentials that satisfy those constraints, such as Tq7#P@m9, are considered “complex” and are stronger and more resistant to attack. However, such complex credentials are also quite unlike\n",

            "existing words and phrases already stored in memory. Novel words and phrases are more difﬁcult to store and recall (Squire 2004). Thus, we would expect that it should be harder to remember complex than simple passwords. However, it is also possible to use a passphrase as a credential. Because a credential’s resistance to brute-force attacks is affected more by its length than by the size of the character set, there are arguments that long passphrases consisting solely of uppercase and lowercase letters are stronger than shorter passwords that include nonletter characters (Keith et al. 2007, 2009). Moreover, because the entire phrase (e.g., IwentsnorkelingintheNationalParkatKeyBiscayne) is used, rather than using only speciﬁc characters from the phrase (e.g., using the ﬁrst letter of each word in the preceding phrase to create IwsitNPaKB) to create a shorter password, it should be easier to correctly recall passphrases than complex passwords. Indeed, evidence indicates that passphrases result in fewer memory-based errors in recall (Jakobsson and Akavipat 2012) and fewer actual login failures based on memory failures (Keith et al. 2007, 2009) than passwords. By contrast, passwords comprised of 12 characters that do not constitute a meaningful phrase are hard to remember (Paul et al. 2011). Thus far, we have discussed the process of creating and initially learning a new authentication credential. However, to retain knowledge, it must be transferred from short-term into long-term memory (Baddeley 2012). Long-term memory can be divided into two primary types: declarative and procedural. The declarative memory system underlies the learning and retention of facts and events (Ullman 2004)— it is the type referred to as “memory” in everyday language (Squire 2004). Declarative memory is almost entirely explicit, meaning it is available at a conscious level. Although authentication credentials may be initially stored as episodic declarative memory—meaning they are tied closely to the cues and details relevant to the event of creating it—they are eventually stored as facts, making them semantic declarative memories. Whereas episodic memories are very event speciﬁc and context speciﬁc—making them less transferrable from one situational recall to another—semantic memories are relatively easier to recall across contexts (e.g., entering the same password on multiple computers). The preceding discussion explains how declarative memory affects credential recall. However, authentication credentials must not only be recalled correctly but also entered correctly into a login prompt. This is the role of procedural memory (Ullman 2013). The procedural memory system represents the motor skills learned from performing a given action or sequence of actions and rules repeatedly\n",

            "(Squire 2004). Procedural memory represents our nonconscious implicit motor skills such as riding a bicycle or entering a password or passphrase via a physical keyboard or touch screen. In summary, authentication credentials are learned in a process that begins with short-term memory, where the credential is rehearsed long enough to transfer it to long-term memory. During initial use of the credential, the user relies primarily on declarative memory to recall it. Then, with practice in entering the credential, it becomes stored in procedural memory. Eventually, because declarative memory tends to decay quickly (Ullman 2004), a user may rely primarily on procedural memory to correctly enter the credential. Credentials that are either adequately rehearsed, well “chunked,” based on meaningful information, or comprised of known words and phrases (or some combination of those factors) will be more easily stored in short-term memory and transferred to declarative memory. Thus, simple passwords and passphrases should be easier to learn and recall than complex passwords comprised of randomly scrambled different types of characters. Furthermore, because complex credentials violate normal typing rules they are more difﬁcult to learn how to enter correctly and, therefore, to store in procedural memory than are either simple passwords or “wordprocessing-compatible” passphrases (i.e., those that use natural words, follow normal rules for capitalization and punctuation, and incorporate numbers as part of dates). Difﬁculty in retrieving the credential from declarative memory increases the likelihood of login failures due to memory problems; poor procedural memory increases the likelihood of login failures due to typographical errors. Thus, the preceding discussion leads to our ﬁrst hypothesis: Hypothesis 1 (H1). Authentication credential complexity is positively related to login failures. 2.1.2. Effect of the User Interface. The authentication task environment, including the UI1 of any IT artifacts employed, may affect both recall of information from declarative memory and the use of procedural knowledge. The UI can affect recall of information from declarative memory by altering the salience of cues. Cues that facilitate recall can be verbal, written, or graphical (Tulving and Pearlstone 1966). In particular, images and text that are present when new information is stored in working memory and transferred\n",

The elements most relevant to the authentication context include the layout of the keyboard (i.e., where the buttons reside), the total number of key presses required to enter a credential, the properties of the password input box, and the graphical- and text-based cues included on the authentication form screen.\n",

            "to long-term memory are effective cues that aid in retrieving that information from long-term memory at a later time (Ericsson and Kintsch 1995). For example, the images incorporated into advertising campaigns are remarkably effective at helping consumers recall brand names (Keller 1987). To understand the role of retrieval cues in credential recall, consider the recommendation to use a different password for each information system (Ives et al. 2004). Since different passwords are used across systems, the text and graphical content of the UI serves as a cue to help a person recall the correct password. Consequently, changing the UI, for example, by switching from a desktop to mobile (MacKay et al. 2004, Wiedenbeck et al. 2005), changes a website’s content and, therefore, may disrupt declarative recall, thereby increasing login failures. As an example, Figure 3 depicts both the desktop and mobile versions of the login screen for JPMorgan Chase. The desktop version contains a variety of images and text that are not present in the mobile version. Indeed, the textboxes and button that allow authentication comprise only a portion of the desktop screen, whereas the mobile version is entirely occupied by the authentication interface. As a result, the user cannot use any of the desktop cues to aid recall on the mobile UI. The nature of the UI can also affect the ability to use procedural knowledge. Full-size physical keyboards clearly display all possible characters and require at most the use of two keys simultaneously to capitalize a letter or enter a special character. By contrast, most touchscreens on mobile devices require considerable effort to change between lowercase and uppercase letters, or to select numbers and special characters. For example, Jakobsson and Akavipat (2012) point out\n",
            "\n",
            "that it takes 21 actions to enter the 12-character credential “ﬂY2theM0On!” on a touchscreen, but requires only 15 key presses if using a physical keyboard. It also requires interrupting the data entry process to decide whether a particular character is on the current screen (Sears and Zha 2003). Consequently, typing on touchscreens is inherently more error prone than typing on keyboards (Lee and Zhai 2009, Park et al. 2008). Indeed, studies have found that it takes two to three times longer to enter a typical complex password on a mobile device with a touchscreen or miniature keyboard than when entering the same credential via a full-sized physical keyboard (Bao et al. 2011). As a result, the touchscreen UI is clearly a unique context from traditional keyboards. As discussed above, procedural memory is difﬁcult to transfer from one context to another (Ullman 2013). Thus, the UI can affect login success by making it harder to both (1) recognize the cues used to recall the correct authentication credential from declarative memory and (2) by restricting the user’s ability to draw from procedural memory. This leads to our second hypothesis: Hypothesis 2 (H2). Login failures will be greater when entering authentication credentials using a miniature keyboard or touchscreen than when using a normal-sized physical keyboard. In addition to directly affecting login success, there is reason to believe that the UI will also moderate the effect of strong credentials on login success. Because the declarative and procedural memory systems interact cooperatively in human learning and processing, negative effects in one system may lead to negative effects on the other (Ullman 2004, 2013).

            "the context of a word recall experiment. After disrupting the procedural memory system, participants performed lower on a word recall task than the control group (Brown and Robertson 2007). This interrelationship between the declarative and procedural memory systems suggests how the design of the UI can affect performance of a security task. Most people have developed procedural knowledge for typing their authentication credentials on the full-sized physical keyboards found on laptop and desktop computers, and can do so with a high rate of success. The different UI found on a mobile device, however, precludes drawing on that previously acquired procedural memory to enter a password with minimal conscious effort. Instead, users must consciously search for whether each character in their credential is visible on the screen or requires pressing a key to access a different touchscreen, while retaining the entire credential in memory. This heightened cognitive burden increases the difﬁculty of learning the new procedural knowledge (Keisler and Shadmehr 2010), thereby increasing the likelihood of login failures due to typing errors. If repeated, such failures may cause users to question whether they are recalling the correct information (i.e., authentication credential) for the task. As a result, the person may then try to resolve the problem by recalling and using different information. Thus, an initial error in applying procedural knowledge (e.g., unsuccessfully entering an authentication credential because of a typographical mistake) may cause a subsequent error in the declarative memory system (e.g., recalling the wrong credential). Thus, the preceding discussion suggests that the difference between the UI provided on mobile devices and that found on laptops and desktop computers is likely to exacerbate the inherent difﬁculty of using strong passwords and leads to our third hypothesis: Hypothesis 3 (H3). The effect of credential strength on login failures will be greater when using a miniature keyboard or touchscreen than when using a normal-sized physical keyboard. 2.2. The Comparator and the Outcome Function: How Experience Inﬂuences (Dis)Continuance Based on the cybernetic feedback loop (Carver and Scheier 1982), after the environment has been disrupted (e.g., via switching to use of a mobile UI for authentication), the user must perceive this disruption (input function), and make a comparison between the new state and the desired state (comparator) that leads to new behavior (next output function) designed to bring the two states into congruence. In the context of authentication, the comparison between expectations and experience (step D in Figure 2) is binary: the user either successfully accesses the system or fails to\n",
            "\n",
            "do so. These two outcomes determine what happens in step E in Figure 2 (selection of a coping behavior). According to cybernetic theory, success requires no change in behavior, because the user has obtained the desired goal. The desired state is what the user expects. Thus, when experience matches the desired state, it represents a conﬁrmation of expectations. IS research on system use has shown that conﬁrmation of expectations (and positive disconﬁrmation, i.e., ﬁnding that a system exceeds expectations) encourages continuance (Bhattacherjee and Premkumar 2004, Hong et al. 2006, Limayem et al. 2007). Hence, in the context of authentication, the login success should encourage continued use of the authentication credential. By contrast, if the comparator (step D in Figure 2) evaluates current experience as not matching the desired state (e.g., in the context of authentication, a login failure), the user takes action (coping behavior, step E in Figure 2) to resolve the discrepancy. As shown in Figure 2, there are three possible responses to a failure to authenticate when using a particular credential. One is to keep using the same credential, repeating the process until achieving success via practice. Another alternative is to store the credential so that it is automatically submitted when authenticating. This solution eliminates login failures, regardless of whether caused by forgetting the credential or difﬁculty in correctly entering it. A third possible solution that also ﬁxes both causes of login failures is to change to a different credential that is easier to remember and easier to type. The ﬁrst alternative (continued use of a credential) is desirable because it maintains security at a given level, whereas the other two alternatives solve the problem, but do so at the expense of weakening security. Prior research in both IS and psychology suggests several reasons why people may discontinue using an authentication credential that results in login failures and switch to an alternative behavior instead. Continued practice using an authentication credential will reduce login failures (Keith et al. 2007, 2009) while maintaining security, but requires time and effort. By contrast, the other possible alternatives (storing the credential for automatic submission or switching to a weaker credential that is easy to enter) quickly resolve the problem of login failures with minimal effort, but do so by weakening security. Research in psychology indicates that decision makers seek to maximize quality (accuracy) while simultaneously minimizing total effort (Payne 1982, Payne et al. 1993). IS research on decision aids has found that people’s perceptions of required effort play a bigger role in their choice of which decision strategy to adopt than does consideration of the relative quality of those options (Todd and Benbasat 1991,\n",

            "1992). In other words, people tend to trade off accuracy for effort. Moreover, this tendency persists even in the presence of explicit incentives related to accuracy (Todd and Benbasat 1999). This effort-accuracy trade-off may explain why people tend to discontinue performing security behaviors that are difﬁcult to perform successfully (Adams and Sasse 1999). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that people will respond to login failures when using a strong credential by discontinuing a difﬁcult to perform behavior (manual entry of a strong authentication credential) and switching to an alternative behavior (e.g., storing their credential so that they do not have to manually enter it or switching to a weaker credential that is easier to enter) that requires less effort to perform successfully. Whereas conﬁrmation of expectations encourages continuance, negative disconﬁrmation of expectations (i.e., experiencing difﬁculties that were either unexpected or greater than anticipated) creates intentions to discontinue use (Bhattacherjee and Premkumar 2004, Brown et al. 2012, Ortiz de Guinea and Webster 2013). Moreover, those studies indicate that negative disconﬁrmation of expectations affects subsequent behavior both directly and, by creating dissatisfaction with the existing state of affairs, indirectly. The direct effect represents the role of cognitive perceptions on behavior, in that a discrepancy between the desired and actual states results in changing behavior to eliminate that discrepancy. The indirect effect, through dissatisfaction, represents the complementary role that emotions play on the decision to (dis)continuance (Ortiz de Guinea and Markus 2009). Dissatisfaction is a negative emotion. There is evidence that “people are motivated to change or alter their environment when in negative moods and to leave well enough alone when in positive moods” (Bargh and Ferguson 2000, p. 932). Furthermore, negative emotions encourage risky behavior (Rydell et al. 2008). In the context of authentication, login failures are likely to be perceived negatively because they deny anticipated access. Therefore, the resulting dissatisfaction may encourage discontinuing the behavior (manual entry of a strong authentication credential) that causes the problem (login failure) and changing to behaviors (e.g., storing the credential for autosubmission or replacing it with a simpler one that is easier to enter) that solve the problem, but do so by increasing risk. In summary, the preceding discussion suggests several complementary reasons why people are likely to respond to login failures (step E in the cybernetic loop depicted in Figure 2, coping behaviors) by discontinuing an existing authentication behavior and replacing it with a less secure behavior. Hence we offer the following multipart hypothesis:\n",
            "\n",
            "Hypothesis 4A (H4A). Login failures will increase the likelihood of storing an authentication credential and having it automatically submitted when attempting to access a remote system. Hypothesis 4B (H4B). Login failures will increase the likelihood of changing an authentication credential to one that is easier to use (shorter or less complex). 2.3. Effect of the User Interface on Coping Response In addition to the effect of login failures, there is also reason to expect that the UI will directly inﬂuence authentication behaviors. As shown in Figure 2, the decision to (dis)continue a behavior is affected by comparing a person’s experience in executing that behavior with the desired/expected state. When the desired and actual states match (i.e., when expectations are conﬁrmed) people are likely to continue the behavior; but when those expectations are disconﬁrmed, they are likely to respond by discontinuing the behavior. The nature and design of the UI plays an important role on that process by affecting how easy (hard) it is to successfully execute a given behavior. Indeed, people’s choice of a decision strategy can be inﬂuenced by changing the design of a decision aid so that it makes one strategy easier than another (Todd and Benbasat 1999). Moreover, ease of use should increase satisfaction and, thereby, the desire to continue using that system or performing a given behavior. By contrast, difﬁculties in use are likely to cause frustration and dissatisfaction, leading to discontinuance. In short, the UI can be either an enabler or inhibitor (Cenfetelli 2004) to the continuance of a security behavior. As discussed earlier, the touchscreen interface provided on smartphones and other mobile devices makes it more difﬁcult to enter long and complex authentication credentials, thereby increasing the likelihood of login failures due to typing errors. In addition, typing difﬁculties may also cause people to question whether they are entering the proper credential, which could, in turn, lead to login failures due to memory errors. Consequently, it is not surprising that many people report that they do not like using such an interface to enter authentication credentials (Trewin et al. 2012). Indeed, there is evidence that some people so dislike the process for entering passwords on touchscreens that they actively seek ways to avoid having to do so (Bao et al. 2011, Jakobsson and Akavipat 2012). This leads to the following multipart hypothesis: Hypothesis 5A (H5A). Ceteris paribus, users will be more likely to store their authentication credential when using a mobile UI.\n",

Effects of Practice and Learning Through repeated practice, people develop procedural memory about how to perform a task (Ullman 2004). As a result, performance tends to improve over time. For example, Keith et al. (2007, 2009) found that over a three-month period, participants in their experiments experienced fewer login failures due to either typographical or memory errors when entering passphrases via full-size physical keyboards. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that any effects associated with using a mobile device to authenticate should decrease over time. Consequently, we explore whether practice using a mobile device to authenticate moderates the effects of the mobile device UI on login failures and coping behaviors.

Participants had to authenticate through the website to view the leaderboard, photos of themselves and others, and details of each clue found (e.g., time span, location on a map, photo, points earned). To encourage participants to return often to the game website (and attempt to authenticate), several other features were implemented. First, participants could create an online proﬁle with a variety of personal and demographic information. Second, an online social network was incorporated into the game that allowed players to follow and track the progress of their friends, refer other players, and exchange messages through the website. Participants could also earn game points for completing their proﬁle, following other players, and referring friends. These features were designed to inspire website interactivity, boost authentication attempts, and create a natural sense of realism and actual privacy risk. To make the game points relevant and desirable to participants, we provided weekly and end-of-game rewards. Each week, we awarded ﬁve to 15 $10 gift cards to the participants who either (1) were ﬁrst to ﬁnd all of that week’s locations, or (2) were randomly selected based on a point-weighted virtual “drawing.” At the end of the game, the two participants with the most total points, and one more based on a point-weighted random drawing, won a new tablet computer. 3.1. Ensuring Experimental Validity Five hundred and sixty-eight undergraduates at a large private university in the western United States participated in the experiment. To generate valid and realistic information disclosure behaviors, participants needed to perceive actual personal risk and fear of disclosing information. This was accomplished in multiple ways. First, we obtained IRB2 approval to not require participants’ informed consent because informed consent automatically elevates participants’ awareness of risk and the artiﬁcial nature of data collection. Rather, participants were recruited under the false pretense that a local mobile app business wanted to pilot test a new geo-caching app at their university. As a result, there was no priming effect on participants and they were less susceptible to social desirability bias (Richman et al. 1999). Moreover, they were told that the friends they referred to the game did not have to be university students or employees.\n",

If the participant was close enough (GPS-veriﬁed) to the location, they could click a “Found it!” button, which would prompt them to take a picture of themselves at the location through the mobile app. If the participant could not decipher the clue, the app provided a closeness meter (see Figure 5(d) and 5(e)) that indicated how geographically close they were to the target clue. This indicator updated in real time allowing the participant to ﬁnd any clue as they travelled around. Participants earned game points for each clue\n",

For example, by choosing an app design with weekly incentives, participants were motivated to play for more than just extra credit. Because it was a geo-caching app, there was a clear need to collect location data, which presents personal safety risks (Baum et al. 2009). The social network aspect of the app created both additional enjoyment as well as creating vertical and horizontal personal information privacy risks (Posey et al. 2010). Thus, participants’ personal information could legitimately be made publicly available—unless they set their privacy settings to restrict their data to “friends only” or “nobody.” This is critical because fear is essential to motivating users to create strong passwords (Vance et al. 2013).\n",

This common architecture allows mobile apps to easily send data to external thirdparty servers. When the app was introduced to participants, they were given a brief explanation of how the mobile app and website worked together with the same data. Consequently, participants were aware that the mobile app was capable of sending personal information to remote servers. 3.2.

The appendix describes several possible measures of credential strength and the reasons that led us to select experts’ subjective assessment to test our hypotheses. Consistent with prior research (Keith et al. 2007, 2009), we measured credential strength by providing the actual authentication credentials to two coders4 who were unaware of the study’s hypotheses and asked them to make a subjective judgment as to whether the credential was “simple,” “moderate,” or “complex” in terms of strength against cracking attempts. Because complex passwords do not follow traditional spellings and language patterns, they are also more resistant to guessing and “cracking.” As a result, the concept of complexity is essentially synonymous with credential strength (Adams et al. 1997, Keith et al. 2009) in the password context. Therefore, the coders were instructed to interpret these terms as being indicative of the likelihood that the credential could be\n",

To further guide their subjective assessments, they were briefed on the objective experimental ﬁndings from prior research (Keith et al. 2007, 2009) on the proven characteristics of strong credentials (e.g., length and character variance). These coders agreed on 81% of the credential ratings K = 0 813 p < 0 001 . When the coders disagreed, we deferred to the practitioner. We used this three-level (simple–moderate–complex) subjective assessment to represent the strength of a participant’s initial authentication credential.5 3.3.2. Login Failures. Actual login failures were measured to represent the environmental impacts in Figure 2. Every login attempt was captured in the database and coded to reﬂect the outcome of that attempt (success or failure). 3.3.3. Longitudinal Authentication Behaviors. We captured two types of longitudinal authentication behaviors. First, for each login attempt we recorded whether the user entered their credential manually or avoided entry by using the “remember me” feature. Higher scores represent a greater percentage of all authentication attempts were performed with a saved credential—thus indicating less secure authentication behavior. Second, we stored every credential a user ever created and had the two judges rate both the initial and changed credentials. We calculated the change in credential strength by subtracting the rating of the old credential from the rating of the new. Both ratings were on three-point scales (simple, moderate, complex), so the change score could range from −2 to +2.6 Thus, negative scores reﬂect changing to a weaker credential, and positive scores reﬂect changing to a stronger credential. 3.3.4. Mobile Interface and Mobile Practice. To test the effects of the UI and practice we collected data about the client browser and operating system information at each login attempt to determine whether the login was from a mobile device or a traditional laptop or desktop computer. We created a variable called mobile interface by calculating the percentage of all login attempts made using a mobile device. However, this does not distinguish between a user who only made two login attempts total with one being from a mobile device and a user who made 20 login attempts, with 10 from a mobile device.

However, most credentials were simple and quickly cracked. Table 4 summarizes descriptive statistics about credential use. Participants attempted to log in from a laptop or desktop more often than from a mobile device (1,612 versus 1,022 attempts). However, 194 (34%) of participants logged into the website via their mobile device at least once, with almost 39% of all website access occurring via mobile device. Login failures were more likely when using a mobile device. Two hundred and eighteen (38%) participants stored their credentials, with storage being more likely when using mobile devices. Seven percent of participants changed their credentials a total of 45 times. Overall, the tendency was to change to a weaker credential: eight participants changed from a complex to a simple credential (change score of −2) and 16 changed from either complex to moderate or moderate to simple (change scores of −1), but only ﬁve people switched to a stronger credential. There was no signiﬁcant difference between passwords (36.2%) and passphrases (35.7%) in terms of storing the credential or changing to a credential that was either weaker or of the same strength (6.5% each). 4.2.

            "This study extends research on voluntary security behaviors by investigating the factors that inﬂuence their (dis)continuance. Drawing on the process portion of the TTAT proposed by Liang and Xue (2009), we ﬁnd that the decision to (dis)continue a security behavior emerges from a cybernetic loop that reﬂects one’s experience in performing that behavior. In other words, although users may initially adopt a secure behavior, they will modify or drop that behavior if it requires too much effort to perform successfully. Speciﬁcally, we found that when a strong authentication credential results in login failures, people tend to either store their authentication credential for autosubmission or to change to a credential that is easier to enter correctly. Both solutions solve the problem of login failures, but do so at the cost of weakening security. Thus, we show that the IT artifact (the nature of the user interface for entering authentication credentials) affects both the success in executing a security behavior and the decision to (dis)continue that behavior. Our ﬁndings have important implications for both research and practice. 5.1. Implications for Research Overall, our results show that a longitudinal and process-oriented perspective is essential to understanding how the IT artifact, speciﬁcally the nature\n",

            "of the user interface, affects user security behaviors. We found a clear cycle of behavior based on temporal introduction of different stimuli. Initially, users create authentication credentials that reﬂect their desire for a given level of security. Subsequently, after users practice a security behavior (by attempting to login through a prompt), their behaviors reﬂect a desire for usability: if their initial authentication credential is too difﬁcult to correctly enter via the UI of a mobile device they either conﬁgure the device to store and automatically submit the credential or they change to a simpler, but weaker, one. From a theoretical perspective, these ﬁndings support cybernetic loop theory (Carver and Scheier 1982) as a process model of security behavior continuance. We thus extend the process version of Liang and Xue’s (2009) TTAT to show that cybernetic processes not only explain how people respond to a threat but also account for how the IT artifact affects their security behaviors. We further contribute to this theory by drawing from research on memory systems (Ullman 2004), IS research on the effect of cognitive load on decision strategy (Todd and Benbasat 1991, 1992, 1999), and psychology research on the role of emotions in decision making (Bargh and Ferguson 2000, Bargh et al. 2001, Chen and Bargh 1999) to explain how the cybernetic loop process model will unfold in the context of authentication security goals and behavior. In particular, two user goals independently and jointly inﬂuence the continuance of secure behaviors over time and cause people to enter additional cycles of the cybernetic feedback loop. The ﬁrst goal is the user’s desire for security, which is currently well explained by variance models such as TTAT (Liang and Xue 2009) and adapted protection motivation-based theories (Johnston and Warkentin 2010, Herath and Rao 2009). The second goal is the user’s desire for usability, which is affected by the nature of the IT artifact (UI) used to perform the task. However, these two goals are not simultaneously considered (e.g., in a cost/beneﬁt trade-off calculation) each time a user must make a decision about their security behaviors. Rather, consideration of the security goal is stimulated by events such as security training and awareness programs (Bulgurcu et al. 2010) or personal experience with security breaches (Herath and Rao 2009), whereas the usability goal is stimulated by difﬁcult experiences with maintaining the security behavior as a person interacts with the IT artifact. Therefore, a theoretical process model that accounts for behavioral adjustments over time best explains behavior. Our ﬁndings also underscore the importance of acknowledging human factors issues, speciﬁcally ease of use, as an inhibitor of secure behavior. Just as people are often willing to trade off accuracy for effort when making decisions (Todd and Benbasat 1991,\n",
            "\n",
            "1992, 1999), our results show that they are willing to trade off security for ease of use. Thus, in our experiment, when people experience repeated login failures when using mobile devices, they respond by switching from a more secure authentication behavior (i.e., manual entry of a strong credential) to less secure, but easier to perform alternatives (use of a simpler credential or storage and autosubmission of the credential). Clearly, there is a need for further theory development and research that focuses on usability when using mobile devices in the authentication process. Prior research on authentication credentials when using physical keyboards provides an example of the kind of approach that is needed. Keith et al. (2007) found that long passphrases which did not reﬂect well-learned typing skills resulted in login failures. Building off that ﬁnding, Keith et al. (2009) hypothesized and found that simple instructions to create passphrases that used basic rules about typing (e.g., capitalization of initial letters of words, use of numbers as parts of dates, etc.) would make such credentials easier to use. In this study, we found that stronger authentication credentials increased login failures. An important topic for future research is to investigate how to design credentials that are strong, yet easy to correctly enter when using mobile devices with virtual touchscreens. Our results also suggest that improving user memory systems (i.e., practice) is not a panacea for the limitations of mobile interface. Although practice did decrease the propensity to switch to weaker credentials when using a mobile device to authenticate, it did not reduce the login failure rate when using a mobile device. Moreover, contrary to expectations, continued practice with the mobile UI to authenticate actually increased the propensity to store those credentials. We propose that these three ﬁndings are interrelated. The ﬁnding that practice did not reduce login failures suggests that entering a password over a mobile UI never became as easy as when using a traditional keyboard and full-sized screen. As explained before, the mobile UI still requires many more keystrokes for the same text (Jakobsson and Akavipat 2012) even if every keystroke is correct. Therefore, the repeated practice of authentication over a mobile UI may have been simply a stark reminder of the extra effort required to enter a strong credential with such a UI, and the concomitant increase in the likelihood of making mistakes. If we are correct that the problem is caused by the nature of the UI, it is logical that users would respond by adopting the coping behavior that resolves the problem by eliminating the need to manually enter the credential—thus, mobile UI practice leading to an increased likelihood of storing the password—rather than the coping behavior\n",

            "that still required manual entry of the credential. However, although plausible, we cannot support this explanation with our data and, therefore, suggest that it is an important topic for future research. 5.2. Implications for Practice Although our study investigates voluntary security behavior, our ﬁndings are relevant to the workplace. Employers are increasingly allowing employees to use their own personal mobile devices to access the corporate network, a practice referred to as “bring your own device” (BYOD). Over time and through repeated experience, people develop habits on how they use technology (Limayem et al. 2007). If employees get habituated to acting in a certain way when using mobile devices for personal use, those habits may carry over when using that same personal mobile device for work. On the surface, the move to use mobile devices to authenticate to remote systems appears likely to improve security because it involves multifactor authentication using a combination of something you have (your mobile device) and something you know (a PIN, password, or passphrase). However, our results suggest that the inherent design features of the mobile UI may actually decrease security because users are likely either to change from a strong, but hard-to-enter, credential to a weaker, but easier to enter, one or to store their credential on the device and conﬁgure it for autosubmission (thus changing what appears to be multifactor authentication to multimodal authentication using two things that a person has: their mobile device and the stored credential). However, mobile devices are susceptible to being lost or stolen; over three million smartphones were stolen in 2013 (ConsumerReports 2014). In addition, people sometimes “loan” their phone to others (Ben-Asher et al. 2011, Karlson et al. 2009). In either case, this increases the risk that whoever has obtained physical possession of the device can attempt to gain unauthorized access to the corporate system. This risk is further increased by the fact that survey data indicate that a majority of companies that currently permit BYOD rely solely on passwords for authentication (Johnson and DeLaGrange 2012). One potential solution to this problem is for people to conﬁgure their mobile devices to require authentication to turn it on. Disturbingly, survey results ﬁnd that many people do not conﬁgure their phones to require any form of authentication (Clarke and Furnell 2005, ConsumerReports 2014, Jones and Heinrichs 2012). Moreover, the majority of people who do conﬁgure a password or PIN to access their phone report that they never change it (Barn et al. 2014). The trend to incorporate biometrics to initially logon to a mobile device (e.g., ﬁngerprints or facial\n",
            "\n",
            "recognition) mitigates the risk that an unauthorized person can use a lost or stolen device. However, the threat is not totally eliminated because (1) it is still possible for people to conﬁgure their device to bypass such controls; (2) the device could be left unattended and stolen after the owner used the biometric to turn it on; and (3) the owner would deﬁnitely have to have authenticated prior to “loaning” the device to another person. Thus, managers need to be concerned about how BYOD might affect employees’ choice and use of authentication credentials. Of course, employers will probably require employees to conﬁgure their mobile devices to require authentication as a condition of permitting BYOD. Employers will also create and enforce policies regarding the need to periodically change passwords. Consequently, the important question is the extent to which employees truly comply with those policies or attempt to circumvent them, for example by storing their credential and conﬁguring their mobile device to automatically submit it whenever they want to login to the corporate system, to make life easier. Our results suggest that this is indeed a potential problem. In summary, our results have implications for both managers and users. Managers need to reconsider how they formulate security policies and deploy new IT artifacts. It is not enough to focus only on how a new technological development or a proposed policy, if properly implemented and complied with, improves security. Managers must also consider how changes in the IT artifact (e.g., replacing a full-size physical keyboard with a virtual touchscreen) and policy requirements (e.g., password credential composition rules) interact with one another in the context in which they will be used. In particular, our results suggest that (1) secure authentication policies that are effective in the desktop computing paradigm will not work in the mobile paradigm, and (2) voluntary secure authentication behaviors that are not adequately usable will be discontinued. Therefore, managers must ensure that a secure authentication policy is sufﬁciently usable or at least ﬁnd ways to force users to comply with it. Otherwise, they risk having their employees develop “creative workarounds” that make it easier to “comply” with policies, but in a manner that actually reduces security. Similarly, users should be wary of our natural tendency to place usability before security and exercise safe judgment in spite of mobile UI limitations. 5.3. Limitations This study is subject to several limitations inherent with the use of student subjects in a controlled experiment. One issue concerns the extent to which the results generalize to other populations of interest.\n",

            "It is possible that age and experience with mobile devices may affect our results. However, as noted earlier, we did test for and failed to ﬁnd evidence that repeated practice in using a mobile device to authenticate ameliorated the login failure rate or the tendency to switch to a simpler credential. Moreover, if it is true, as it is sometimes argued, that younger people have fewer problems using IT than do older people, then the use of students as subjects may actually understate the magnitude of the problems associated with using complex authentication credentials to log in via mobile devices. Another issue is that controlled experiments may cause participants to behave differently than they would in real situations. As we explained when describing our research design, we took several steps to mitigate that risk, including obtaining permission to not inform participants that this was an experiment. In addition, we designed the experiment so that participants believed that they were playing a game. Gamiﬁcation has been shown to cause people to become absorbed in the immediate task (i.e., playing the game) and, thereby, to reveal more realistic behaviors (Agarwal and Karahanna 2000, Deterding 2012, Hoffman and Novak 1996, Singh 2012). Furthermore, the game data stored in their ﬁndamine proﬁle had strategic value in the context of the game itself: a player who accessed other players’ accounts could view their clues about the target locations. Therefore, much like a poker player needs to keep their cards private, ﬁndamine players needed to keep their clues private, which should have motivated them to restrict access to those data via use of a strong authentication credential. There was also an element of personal risk associated with unauthorized access to their personal information. Although ﬁndamine did not include credit card or bank account information, it did record and share their GPS location, social network connections, and demographic proﬁle data similar to that found in major online social networks. Disclosure of GPS information enables criminals to stalk victims, which can lead to robberies when the victim is not home (Johanson 2013) or serious physical crimes such as assault, rape, or murder (Baum et al. 2009, HufﬁngtonPost 2012). In summary, we believe that our participants were motivated to participate in a variety of ways for an assortment of reasons. One potential source of variance not accounted for in our study is that mobile users may employ an external keyboard when using their device.7 It was not possible to capture this nuance in the client variables we recorded in each login attempt. However, such behavior by participants in our study would only bias against ﬁnding any difference in login failure rates due to different UI.\n",

            "The design of our experiment did not permit us to collect data to determine whether the reason that participants discontinued a strong authentication behavior was primarily cognitive (i.e., a conscious attempt to reduce effort) or emotional (dissatisfaction or annoyance). However, both explanations are consistent with predictions based on cybernetic loop theory that people will respond to repeated login failures by discontinuing a behavior that leads to task failure. We leave exploration of this issue as a topic for future research. Finally, we drew on existing knowledge about memory systems to derive implications concerning the effect of the UI on the continuance of secure behavior. However, our understanding of how memory systems function is continually evolving (Baddeley 2012). Therefore, IS security researchers need to monitor new insights from psychology research on memory because those ﬁndings may suggest even more effective ways to design the UI to best support secure behaviors.\n",

            "This paper reports the results of a ﬁeld experiment that investigated the effect of an IT artifact (the nature of the UI) on authentication behaviors. Our most important ﬁnding is that user authentication behaviors differ depending on whether they are using traditional computers or mobile devices for remote access to a network. We demonstrate that those differences are due to differences in the UI of the two types of devices. Thus, our study underscores the need for security researchers and practitioners to consider how the IT artifact interacts with task characteristics (e.g., requirements about authentication credential composition) when considering the effects of adopting new technologies or changing security requirements. As Adams and Sasse (1999, p. 40) argue, “users are not the enemy” but only create problems because of mismatches between human capabilities and the requirements of secure behavior.

            "and Mycielski 1975). Entropy represents the difﬁculty of attempting a brute-force approach to guessing a credential, with higher levels of entropy indicating a “stronger” credential. Entropy is considered a more accurate measure of true credential strength against cracking than merely calculating the total number of possible password combinations based on a given length and character set, N L (Johansson and Riley 2005) because the length of a password, in bits, plus the size of the character set, creates a doubling of the number of guesses required for brute-force cracking for each bit added to the password information. However, credential entropy is still only a hypothetical measure of strength. The actual words and word permutations commonly used in credentials, and also found in rainbow tables,8 is constantly changing based on user behavior. Therefore, we created NT hashes9 of each password used and then used two separate programs to see which credentials could be cracked. The ﬁrst program was an opensource program called Ophcrack. All of the free rainbow tables that came with Ophcrack were used. The other program was a private paid application called Hash Suite with more advanced rainbow tables. The second measure of credential strength (i.e., initial coping behavior) was whether the user’s credential could be cracked by either of these programs. Both entropy and credential crack rate are summarized by credential type in Table 3. Because both of the objective measures listed above contain known potential measurement and error issues, we also considered experts’ assessment of credential strength, a subjective measure used in prior research (Keith et al. 2007, 2009). We recruited two independent expert judges— who had no part or stake in the outcome of the research— to rate each credential’s complexity and strength as “simple,” “moderate,” or “strong.” These coders agreed on 81% of the credential ratings K = 0 813 p < 0 001 . When the coders disagreed, we chose to use the decision by the expert practitioner. Table A.1 shows that all three measures were correlated with one another. Both entropy and expert judgment are negatively correlated with cracked. Thus, as expected, credentials with higher entropy are less likely to be cracked. Similarly, credentials judged to be complex are less likely to be cracked than credentials that experts assessed as being simple. Table A.1 also shows that entropy and expert judgment are positively correlated, but apparently also measure different aspects of credential strength. Therefore, we\n",

            "investigated how well each measure related to whether a particular credential was likely to be cracked. Table A.2 lists several example passwords10 and their subsequent entropy scores, expert ratings, and whether or not it was successfully cracked. Note that the ﬁrst two passwords (password and wrosapsd), have the exact same entropy scores because they are of the same length and are derived from the same character base (lowercase letters). However, the expert judged the latter to be moderately complex (2) but considered the former to be simple (1), and those judgments were consistent with the fact that “wrosapsd” was not cracked, whereas “password” was. Now consider the second two passwords: “icecreamsandwhich” has a higher entropy score than does “Extra8iscuit$” because of its length, but “Extra8iscuit$” comes from a larger character base that includes both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and characters. Once again, the expert correctly judged “Extra8iscuit$” to be more complex: it was not cracked, but “icecreamsandwhich” was. The last two passwords represent a situation where the password cracking software was a poor indicator of complexity because it was able to crack the higher entropy password of “Basketball11” but not the lower entropy password of “icanﬁnd.” This is because the success of the cracking software depends on the quality of the rainbow tables. If the rainbow table is poor, then the cracking results will also be poor. In this case, the expert judged both passwords to be moderately complex (2): “icanﬁnd” because it was a phrase and not a single word; “Basketball11” because it contained multiple types of characters and was longer even though it was a single word. These three examples suggest that expert judgment is likely a better indicator of true credential strength than entropy scores. We think that one reason for this difference is that the chance of login failures increases with the number of keystrokes required to enter a credential, but the entropy scores for two credentials may not be related to the number of keypresses required to enter that credential. For example, refer back to the second pair of credentials in Table A.2. The ﬁrst, “icecreamsandwhich” has an entropy\n",

Entropy scores also do not take into account the nature of keypresses. The 17 keypresses required to enter “icecreamsandwhich” each only require pressing one ﬁnger at a time on a physical keyboard. They also require pressing only one key at a time on a virtual touchscreen, without the need to ever shift displays. By contrast, entering the credential “Extra8iscuit$” on a physical keyboard requires pressing two keys simultaneously twice (shift plus e to yield E, and shift plus 4 to yield $). On a virtual touchscreen, it requires changing the display ﬁve times (once to shift to capital letters, once to return to lowercase, once to change to numbers, once to return to lowercase, and once to display special symbols including the $). We believe that the need to either press multiple keys simultaneously on a physical keyboard or the need to continually press a key to change the display on a virtual touchscreen increases the probability of a typing mistake. Therefore, based on the preceding discussion, and to be consistent with prior research on the use of authentication credentials (Keith et al. 2007, 2009), we chose to use expert judgment as our measure of credential strength.\n",

            "Information goods providers such as print newspapers are experimenting with different pricing models for their online content. Despite research on the topic, it is still not clear how information pricing strategy influences word-of-mouth (WOM) via social media, which has become a dominant channel for raising awareness about a newspaper’s articles and attracting new visitors to its website. Using The New York Times’ paywall rollout as a natural experiment, our study examines how the implementation of paywall by a firm (i.e., a shift from “free” to “for-a-fee”) influences the pattern and effectiveness of online WOM in social media. Our results indicate that implementing a paywall (i.e., charging for content that was earlier available for free) has a disproportionate impact on WOM for popular and niche articles, creating a longer tail in the WOM (i.e., content sharing) distribution. Further, we find that the impact of WOM on the NYT’s website traffic weakens significantly after the introduction of a paywall. These results show that a paywall has implications for product and promotion strategies. The study offers novel and important implications for the theory and practice of strategic use of social media and paywall.

Specifically, declining circulation of print newspapers (Vanacore 2010) and an increasing trend toward digital news consumption by consumers have driven traditional print newspapers to adopt the Internet as the medium to offer digital content. However, given the intense competition in the online news market and almost zero marginal cost for providing news online, newspapers find it difficult to charge a fee for accessing their online content (Chyi 2005). Therefore, most online newspapers have been providing content free of charge while making money from online advertising. However, as more consumers switch from print to online news consumption, the online advertising revenue (which is significantly lower than print ad revenue) does not counter-\n",

            "balance the loss of revenue from print newspaper subscribers (Peters 2011). Given these realities, it is not surprising that print news publishers have been debating the tradeoff of charging a fee versus providing the content for free. Charging a fee can increase the total revenue that a publisher receives from online consumers. However, it is likely to significantly decrease online readership (Chyi 2005), which in turn, will lower the total revenue that comes from online advertisements (Dewan et al. 2003). The New York Times (NYT) is one such newspaper experimenting with different pricing models for their online content. Learning from its 2005 failure (when the NYT charged for access to content from noted columnists but could not get significant subscribers for such paid content), NYT rolled out a new paywall strategy in March 2011. Since both subscriptions and ad revenues are a function of the newspaper’s readership, it is important for NYT to ensure that the traffic to its website does not drop significantly. Recognizing the importance of retaining the current NYT website visitors with possibly low willingness to pay (WTP), NYT has implemented a generous access policy allowing non-subscribers to read 20 articles for free (Peters 2011). However, merely retaining current customers is not enough, and like other business, a newspaper publisher needs to rely on advertising and word-of-mouth (WOM) to increase awareness and to acquire new customers (subscribers as well as non-subscribers). In the context of online newspapers, WOM via social media is a dominant channel for raising awareness about a newspaper’s articles and acquiring new visitors to newspaper’s website. The WOM about news content is generated as individuals share the content in the social media by posting links to the news article. It is important to note that since content sharing is implicit WOM about an article’s importance or relevance, we refer to content sharing as WOM in this paper. Recognizing the importance of social media such as Twitter and Facebook in creating WOM about online content and a resulting increase in awareness and traffic,2 the NYT designed its paywall with a special access policy for social media users. Specifically, NYT allowed individuals to bypass the paywall when they access NYT content by following NYT webpage links shared in social media. Industry experts and market researchers suggest that the introduction of a subscription fee model would lower the NYT’s website traffic (Regan 2011). However, it is not clear how this new paywall strategy will impact the WOM dynamics of\n",

            "the NYT’s content in online social media.3 Given the importance of online social media for the sustainability and growth of content providers such as NYT, our study examines the impact of a paywall on the pattern and effectiveness of such WOM in social media. Specifically, using NYT’s recent adoption of a digital subscription model as a natural experiment, we examine how a paywall influences the patterns of WOM on Twitter (i.e., NYT news article links shared in tweets).4 We further analyze how a paywall affects the effectiveness of WOM. Specifically, we examine the relationship between the volume of WOM on Twitter and NYT’s website traffic and how this dynamic changes after implementation of the paywall. The results show that the implementation of a paywall decreased the volume of WOM, and had a disproportionate impact on WOM distribution. Specifically, the results suggest that the WOM for popular content dropped significantly, resulting in less concentration of popular content in WOM distribution. Our analysis to test the plausibility of a mechansim based on exposure theory as the underlying driver of the long tail5 suggests that light users who consume few articles have a tendency to consume popular articles. After the paywall was introduced, light users had a higher likelihood of reducing NYT content consumption due to their low WTP for content. The relatively larger reduction of NYT content consumption by light users who prefer popular content reshaped the WOM distribution. To examine the effectiveness of WOM, we combined Twitter content sharing data with NYT’s website traffic data. Our results show that the volume of social media WOM had a\n",

There were criticisms about NYT’s pricing strategy (McAthy 2013). However, NYT gained about 390,000 user conversions to paid digital subscriptions by the end of 2011.

First, we complement the extant research in the information goods pricing literature by proposing and empirically showing the significant interplay between a firm’s pricing strategy (i.e., paywall) and WOM pattern and effectiveness. The unique natural experiment created by NYT’s paywall rollout helps to control for confounding factors. Second, our study contributes to the WOM literature that measures the impact of online WOM on various performance measures by highlighting the role of WOM on newspaper website traffic and by proposing a moderating role of a paywall on the relationship between WOM and performance outcome (i.e., website traffic). Third, we contribute to the theory of exposure and variety seeking by indirectly validating the theory by employing a finite mixture model. Last, we extend the literature examining various aspects of long tail phenomenon, especially in the online context, by examining the impactof a paywall on the long tail in the distribution of online WOM for information goods such as newspaper articles. Our findings also have significant implications to firms, such as newspaper companies, who are experimenting with news content (i.e., a type of information good) pricing. First, our study suggests that before implementing a paywall, a firm should consider the impact of such a pricing decision on WOM dynamics, which may indirectly affect future revenues. Second, our results highlight the need to measure and manage the impact of a firm’s strategy on WOM. Finally, the shift in the distribution of online WOM after a paywall is introduced has implications for product and news content pricing strategies.

Researchers have primarily employed analytical modeling approaches to analyze optimal pricing strategies for information goods under different contexts (Chellappa and Shivendu 2005; Khouja and Park 2007; Sundararajan 2004) and to study the interaction between the information goods pricing strategy and a firm’s product strategies such as bundling (Bakos and Brynjolfsson 1999; Wu et al. 2008), versioning (Chen and Seshadri 2007), and differentiation (Choudhary 2010). Extending this stream of literature, we employ an empirical approach that examines the interaction between an information goods pricing strategy and WOM dynamics. Recently, given the intense competition in the information goods markets such as online news and consumers’ low WTP for online content due to the existence of free online and offline alternatives, the freemium pricing strategy is gaining popularity. A firm employing the freemium pricing strategy offers free content (i.e., product) supported by online advertising revenue and offers premium content to paying subscribers (Anderson 2009). Although recent empirical research has found that community participation (Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2013) and social contagion (Bapna and Umyarov 2015) may have a positive impact on the success of a firm’s freemium strategy, moving from free ad-supported content to the freemium model is challenging. Given the low WTP for online news (Chyi 2005), one can expect that the online readership of a newspaper may decline after the introduction of a paywall. However, it is not evident how the transition from “free” to “for-a-fee” would impact the WOM about the newspaper’s content. Therefore, our study draws upon insights from the existing literature to investigate the impact of charging a fee for news content on WOM dynamics related to news content in social media.\n",

            "In a social media WOM process, individuals transmit articles they evaluate to be worth sharing. For example, a user’s sharing of a tweet6 or retweet,7 containing the link to a newspaper article, can be considered as implicit WOM (e.g., recommendation to read the article) about an article’s importance. Therefore, content sharing is considered as WOM in this paper. Such WOM not only acts as a signal about the importance or relevance of the content of the article (in the view of the sender) but it also allows dissemination of the content itself within the social network. Thus, WOM about newspaper articles in social media also affords an opportunity for receivers to consume the content.8 A significant body of WOM research has examined a wide variety of issues related to WOM. Of particular interest to our study is the research on patterns and effectiveness of WOM. Researchers have identified various interesting distribution patterns of WOM. Focusing on the temporal pattern of the WOM, researchers have examined how the average valence of WOM varies over time. The empirical evidence suggests that the average valence tends to decrease as time progresses because earlier consumers of a product (who are also likely to be early reviewers) tend to be more zealous about it (Hu et al. 2007; Li and Hitt, 2008). Examining the distribution of WOM in terms of valence, Hu et al. (2007) found that online WOM about products is skewed toward positive valence, creating an asymmetric bimodal (J-shaped) distribution. They suggest that the J-shaped distribution results from two sources of self-selection biases: purchasing and underreporting. Recently, researchers have examined the distribution of WOM for hit/niche products and found a U-shaped relationship between WOM volume and popularity of product (Dellarocas et al. 2010). These results suggest that consumers are more likely to generate WOM for extreme products— niche products or hit products—in terms of popularity. Similar to Dellarocas et al. (2010), our study also examines the distribution of WOM for hit/niche products. However, our focus is on examining the change in the distribution of WOM for hit/niche content as a result of implementation of a paywall. Effectiveness of WOM has also been studied recently. Research suggests that online WOM impacts various perforA tweet is a short message sent by a sender to its recipients on Twitter, a social media platform.\n",

It has been argued that awareness and persuasion are significant underlying cognitive processes of WOM that impact consumer behavior and consequent outcomes (Duan et al. 2008; Liu 2006). Volume and valence are among the most important WOM attributes that have been examined to understand the effectiveness of WOM (e.g., Liu 2006). Volume measures the total amount of WOM interactions, while valence captures the nature of WOM messages (i.e., positive or negative). Research suggests that both volume and valence of WOM have a significant impact on product sales (Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006), while some prior empirical studies indicate that the volume of WOM is more effective than the valence due to the relative dominance of awareness effect vis-à-vis persuasion effect (Liu 2006). In our context, volume is more relevant than valence. Given that users in social media are generating WOM about news content to communicate the importance or relevance of news articles to others, articles that are below a certain threshold in terms of importance or relevance (in the opinion of the WOM sender) will not be shared whereas articles that exceed this threshold will be shared. As a result, all of the news articles that are shared will have high valence. Moreover, the valence is unobserved in the present context. Therefore, we focus on the impact of volume of WOM on performance outcome. Specifically, since website traffic is an important proxy for subscription and advertising revenue, we examine the impact of WOM volume on newspaper website traffic. Further, we extend this research stream by highlighting the role of information pricing strategy in moderating the impact of WOM on performance outcome (i.e., website traffic).\n",

Further, given that the volume of WOM in a social media also depends on the viral spread of the content through relationships among members of the social network, the lack of seeds that can be retransmitted by other members in the social media will lower the amount of retweets, thus weakening the potential viral effect. As a result, a paywall will lead to lower WOM by decreasing both the amount of links to news content shared through seeds and retransmission of seeds. Further, retransmission volume may also be indirectly affected by a paywall due to the possible change in the characteristics of the content being tweeted. Given that a seed tweet containing a link (i.e., URL) to niche content has a lower likelihood of being clicked/read (which generally is a precondition for retweeting) than popular content, if a paywall increases (decreases) the proportion of popular articles that are tweeted vis-à-vis niche articles, the retweet volume may increase (decrease) exponentially due to network effects. Finally, if a sizable proportion of readers decide to change their sharing behavior and increase their propensity to tweet and/or retweet to help their subscribers/followers on social media bypass9 the NYT paywall, then it is even possible to observe an increase in the amount of NYT WOM. Given that the net result of a paywall on WOM volume would depend on the relative strength of these forces, we empirically examine the impact of a paywall on WOM volume. Distribution of WOM: To the extent that a paywall leads to a reduction of the volume of WOM due to a significant proportion of users who have low WTP for content (Chyi 2005), causing them not to adopt the subscription model and discontinue or reduce their consumption of NYT content, the paywall is also likely to shift the distribution of the WOM. Readers of an online newspaper exhibit heterogeneity in terms of WTP for accessing the digital content. Although WTP may depend on a variety of factors (Chyi 2005), we focus on the usage intensity (i.e., the number of articles read and/or shared), which is one of the important factors that influence the value of the product/service in the context of a subscription for accessing content. Consequently, usage intensity is expected to determine whether a consumer will subscribe to the content at a given price or not (Danaher 2002). The NYT’s paywall pricing strategy essentially creates two versions of the product: a free version that allows access to fewer than 20 articles in a month and a subscription version that allows unlimited access to all content. Consumers who read/share few articles (referred to as light users) are very\n",

            "sensitive to price (Danaher 2002) and therefore are more likely to select the free version or switch to alternative news sources because of their low WTP. In such a freemium model, light users are further classified into two groups: (1) consumers who read less than the free article limit and (2) consumers who read more than the free article limit but read less than the threshold to convert to subscribers. The first group of light users does not necessarily leave the NYT and will not affect the WOM distribution after introductoin of the paywall.10 Light users who are in the second group can make two possible subscription decisions: (1) Reduce their consumption to fewer than the 20 free articles limit (2) Discontinue their consumption of the NYT news content and switch to alternative news sources Both of these cases influence the net effect of the NYT’s paywall on its WOM distribution. Consumers who are heavy users (i.e., read/share more articles) will be more willing to subscribe and select the paid version because of their high willingness to pay. As a result, after the paywall implementation, the distribution of users in terms of their usage will shift toward heavy users as the paywall will disproportionately affect light users who will have a higher reduction in their consumption of NYT content (which in extreme cases may even lead to their discontinuation of NYT content consumption, i.e., attrition) due to the paywall restriction. The definition of usage intensity construct, its operationalization, and literature supporting the operationalization is presented in Table 1. Next, we argue that this disproportionate reduction in the consumption of NYT content by light users, after the paywall, will affect the distribution of the NYT articles read and shared.

In fact, in our study period in 2011, the free article limit of the NYT paywall was 20 articles per month, but the NYT reduced this allowance to 10 articles per month later in 2012. Further, it is important to note that the larger the percentage of such users who read less articles in a month than the monthly free articles limit set by NYT paywall, the more difficult it would be to find a significant change in the volume or pattern of NYT WOM that can be attributed to the paywall. Therefore, our results showing significant change in volume and pattern of NYT WOM suggest that this group of users is relatively small.\n",

As a consequence of the reduced consumption of light users who are expected to disproportionately consume more popular articles, there would also be a change in the distribution of the WOM about NYT’s content in social media after the paywall implementation. Specifically, as the number of consumers generating WOM about popular content (and/or the amount of popular content that a consumer consumes) will decrease disproportionately, the distribution of WOM will shift toward the articles in the tail of the content popularity distribution (i.e., a decrease in the volume of WOM at the head of the content popularity distribution will be stronger vis-à-vis a decrease in the volume of WOM at the tail of the content popularity distribution), thus leading to long-tail distribution of NYT WOM. On the other hand, if the users with low WTP (who reduce their consumption of NYT content after introduction of the paywall) are not systematically different—in terms of the preference for popular versus niche content—than those with high WTP (who do not alter their consumption after introduction of the paywall), then, although the volume of NYT WOM may decrease, the WOM pattern would not change after introduction of the paywall as the reduced consumption will also exhibit the same proportion of popular and niche content. Thus, we would not observe any significant change in the NYT WOM distribution after introduction of the paywall. In other words, our argument relies on exposure theory to posit that the paywall will lead to long-tail distribution of NYT WOM content. However, relying on exposure theory is not the only plausible mechanism that may lead to long-tail distribution. An alternative mechanism that may also lead to long-tail effect relies on the user’s strategic behavior when faced with the decision to curtail their consumption.11 Up to now, we have not made\n",

To the extent that the users are strategic in their decision to choose whether to curtail popular content consumption or to curtail niche content consumption, given that they have to reduce their overall content consumption, we can apply information economics and search cost theory to understand the behavior of such strategic users and its implication on the long-tail effect.12 Such strategic users would compare the search cost for finding the content they have to forego on the NYT website on an alternative news or similar website and curtail the consumption of the content type that requires lower search cost to find on an alternative website.13 Given that popular content is available at most of the websites whereas niche content (in most cases) is exclusive to a specific website, it is easier to find popular content that appears on the NYT website on alternative websites.

In other words, we will have to assume that those users who are more likely to read popular content, vis-à-vis those who read both popular and niche content, are also more likely to feel resentment after introduction of the paywall and thus would stop reading NYT. However, in the absence of a convincing rationale or theory to support such an assumption, we rule out this mechanism and focus on other mechanisms that may generate the long-tail effect. Follow-up research may measure users’ emotional response to a paywall using survey data collected from users who discontinued reading NYT and relate it to their content preference and WTP. Further, there may be other alternative theories to explain the long-tail result that we demonstrate in this paper and follow-up research may be needed to identify and isolate any such plausible mechanisms that may also lead to a long-tail result.\n",
            "12 We would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this alternative mechanism. 13 Another possibile strategic behavior is when a segment of heavy users decide to curtail their consumption of NYT, in order to avoid paying the subscription fee, by strategically reducing their consumption of popular content on NYT (as the search cost for finding such content on an alternative website is low). To the extent that there is a significant number of users in such a heavy user segment, we are likely to see a long-tail effect due to the reduction in popular content consumption/sharing; however, unlike the arguments based on WTP, this reduction would be due to the change in the behavior of heavy users rather than light users.\n",

Although this alternative mechanism, which builds upon search cost theory, does not rely on exposure theory, it complements and extends the exposure theory-based mechanism. Specifically, if low WTP users, who are likely to consume a larger proportion of popular products, are also likely to strategically curtail their NYT content consumption such that they selectively reduce a larger proportion of content with lower search costs (as per search cost theory), then the long-tail effect would be stronger as more popular content will be curtailed vis-à-vis niche content. Given the abovementioned mechanisms that suggest the possibility of the NYT paywall leading to a long-tail effect, we empirically test whether the introduction of paywall leads to a longer tail (less concentrated) WOM distribution (i.e., the volume of WOM for popular content will drop more than the volume of WOM for niche content).\n",

            "the seeders are regular visitors to NYT’s website. To the extent the WOM by these initial seeders reaches those network members (either to their direct followers and/or other network members who are exposed to the WOM spread through retransmission decisions by followers) who are not frequent visitors to the NYT website and a significant proportion of them decide to visit the website, the increase in WOM would lead to higher website traffic. To summarize, in aggregate, the WOM about a firm’s content in online social networks is likely to bring new readers (who directly or indirectly follow the seed reader) to the firm’s websites. Although intuitive, we empirically measure the strength of the positive relationship between WOM volume (i.e., social media buzz) and website traffic so that we may examine how this association changes after a paywall implementation. We now turn to an examination of how a paywall moderates this positive relationship between WOM volume and website traffic. There are two competing effects explaining the impact of a paywall implementation on the effectiveness of WOM. In this highly connected digital age, firms are aware of the value of social media and actively engage it in their business strategy. For example, NYT allows visitors who come from links on social media to bypass its paywall. If this bypass effect (i.e., an increase in the likelihood of nonsubscribers’ clicking on NYT content available through social media as they attempt to maximize the number of articles that can be accessed without paying a subscription fee) is dominant in website traffic generation, the relative strength of the relationship between social media WOM and website traffic may increase after a paywall implementation. However, there is another argument suggesting a negative effect on the relationship between the volume of WOM and website traffic after a paywall implemention. Research suggests that content characteristics play a significant role in determining the virality of online content (Berger and Milkman 2012). As we argued in the previous section, a paywall may lead to a disproportionate decrease in the WOM about popular content. Given that popular articles contain content for which there is a greater demand from a larger audience (Zentner et al. 2013), we expect that a decrease in the proportion of WOM about popular content will in turn lower the average clicks per link shared through social WOM. Therefore, the virality effect works in the opposite direction to the bypass effect mentoined above. We expect that the bypass effect will not be able to mitigate the negative effect of changes in WOM distribution because the virality effect can be exponential through online social networks (Shi et al.\n",

            "Next we focus on WOM effectiveness. In our context, WOM effectiveness refers to the ability of the WOM to increase the number of individuals who consume the information good. Given that the consumption of newspaper articles occurs at the newspaper’s website, an increase in consumption is synonymous with an increase in website traffic. Therefore, we examine the association between the volume of online WOM (also referred to as social media buzz) and website traffic. The WOM generated as a result of content spreading over an online social network through transmission, consumption, and retransmission of information (Berger and Milkman 2011; Stephen and Lehmann 2012) creates awareness about the content and increases the set of potential users who can consume the content. The initial group of users who post a message containing a link to an article, also referred to as seeders, broadcast their opinion about the importance or relevance of an article to their followers.

As such, we expect that the paywall will weaken the strength of the relationship between social media WOM and website traffic due to the changes in the distribution of WOM after the paywall implementation. However, it is an empirical question as to which effect is dominant, and we examine the net impact of the paywall on the relationship between the volume of WOM and website traffic.14 Hence, we examine whether the positive relationship between WOM volume (i.e., social media buzz) and website traffic is weakened after a paywall introduction. A summary of alternative plausible mechanisms that may drive the impact of a paywall on the pattern and effectiveness of WOM, a brief rationale and assumptions underlying the mechanisms, and theoretical as well as empirical support for or against these mechanisms is provided in Appendix A.\n",

In order to isolate this time trend effect and the influence of other extraneous factors, we employ a difference-indifference approach and use Los Angeles Times (LAT) as a control group. LAT is a major national newspaper in a different geographic region.15 We collected tweets that contain newspaper link sharing for NYT and LAT articles between February 26, 2011, and March 18, 2011, and between April 4, 2011, and April 24, 2011, respectively. Because Twitter APIs do not allow us to collect population sized historical tweets, we obtained the exhaustive dataset containing all public NYT and LAT link sharing on Twitter through a Twitter-licensed data reseller company. The keywords used in data collection include nyti.ms (lat.ms), nytimes.com (latimes.com) and @nytimes (@latimes).16 Our final data sets contain 1,287,570 tweets containing NYT links and 226,911 tweets containing LAT links. The population size of the data allows us to create and analyze the distributions of WOM in terms of content popularity, which is elaborated below. We were also able to obtain daily website traffic data for the two newspapers in the same time period from HitWise, a marketing research firm that collects aggregate clickstream data17 from a geographically diverse range of ISP networks and opt-in panels, representing all types of Internet usage, including home, work, educational, and public access. In order to support our use of Twitter WOM for a proxy of article reading, we conducted an online survey using Google consumer survey panels. Out of 613 survey respondents residing in the U.S., 103 participants responded that they share news articles on Facebook and/or Twitter. We asked the approximate numbers of their online newspaper reading (mean: 38.4, SD: 69.4), sharing on Facebook (mean: 5.7, SD: 15.15), and sharing on Twitter (mean: 5, SD: 19.18) in\n",

To test this question, we combine data from two sources: NYT link sharing on Twitter and website traffic for 21 days before and after NYT’s paywall rollout. Although there is no rule of thumb regarding the appropriate length of a time window, we chose a 21 day study period before and after the paywall based on the recent empirical studies on content diffusion using large-scale Twitter data. Empirical studies note that content diffusion on Twitter occurs relatively fast (Goel et al. 2012; Kwak et al. 2010), reporting that half of retweeting occurs within an hour and 75 percent in under a day and that the timescale of diffusion on Twitter lasts only a few days in most cases.

We compute the counts of NYT WOM and LAT WOM, which are used as the dependent variables for examining the impact of paywall on the volume of WOM. We examine the distribution of WOM by computing WOM Rank of Content from both the NYT and LAT data sets. Consistent with prior empirical studies (Brynjolfsson et al. 2011; Brynjolfsson et al. 2003), the NYT Content with highest WOM is assigned the lowest value for WOM Rank of Contenti. We follow prior long tail studies (Brynjolffson et al. 2011; Brynjolffson et al. 2003; Zentner et al. 2013) and measure popularity of content in a relative sense using an ordinal ranking of the content based on frequency of content sharing. In our sample, a significant proportion of tweets contained NYT and LAT links to past articles, which may create positive inflation of the paywall effect because the articles in the pre-paywall block simply had a longer duration in our sample, allowing greater opportunity for these articles to be shared. To prevent this bias, we use a 1-day horizon (i.e., only focus on the WOM for an article that was generated on the same day the article was published) in measuring the dependent variables.

Since the inclusion of the paywall dummy variable and the interaction term of paywall and the lagged variable of Tweets volume may lead to high multicollinearity, which, if uncorrected, may lead to inflated standard errors and even inconsistent or unstable estimates, we mean-centered these variables before generating their interaction term.\n",

We checked the key demographics of NYT and LAT website visitors that can influence their news content consumption and sharing behavior: household income, age, and gender. Table C1 in Appendix C indicates that the two groups are qualitatively similar in both demographic variables and that selection issues in demographics are not severe. Then, following DID research (Bertrand et al. 2004),18 we look at whether the NYT and LAT website visits have similar time trends in the absence of the intervention (i.e., NYT paywall introduction). In order to conduct a statistical test for a pre-treatment parallel time trend check, we conduct a newspaper group (i.e., NYT) fixed effects panel regression with a set of pre-treatment dummies using the website visit data. We utilize a longer time frame (10 weeks from January 8, 2011, to March 18, 2011) for weekly time dummies.

Distribution of WOM: DDD Analysis To test whether the introduction of a paywall leads to a longer tail of WOM distribution (i.e., the volume of WOM for popular content will drop more than the volume of WOM for niche content), we employ two long-tail measures. First, we calculated the Gini coefficients of the WOM distribution based on the Lorenz curves (Brynsolfsson et al. 2011). The results indicate that the Gini coefficient for WOM for NYT articles in the pre-paywall period (0.816) is greater than the coefficient in the post-paywall period (0.762). On the other hand, the Gini coefficients of LAT do not exhibit differences before or after NYT’s paywall rollout (0.653 and 0.630, respectively). This suggests that the WOM for popular articles has decreased in the case of NYT after the paywall. Second, since the Gini coefficient analysis does not allow tests to assess whether these differences are statistically significant or not, we employ a log-linear regression specification to examine how a paywall reshapes the WOM distribution with respect to content popularity (Brynjolfsson et al. 2011; Brynjolfsson et al. 2003). Specifically, we fit WOM and WOM Rank of Content to log-linear regressions that model the power-law distributions of WOM at the content level. Hence, all non-categorical variables in our long tail analyses are log transformed, thereby allowing us to identify percentage changes in effect. Then, we create a Paywall dummy (defined as 0 if an observation is in the pre-paywall period, otherwise 1) and interact it with ln(WOM Rank of Content). Finally, in line with our prior DID formulation, our model incorporates LAT as a control group. Paywalli × ln(WOM Rank of Contenti) × NYTi is the three way interaction between\n",

The β7 coefficient on the three-way interaction of the paywall, NYT and WOM rank terms is statistically significant. The interaction plots in Figure 3 illustrate the two-way interactions between paywall and WOM rank. As shown in Figure 3a, the absolute value of the slope coefficient for NYT decreases after the paywall implementation. The results suggest that the paywall rollout leads to a shift of NYT’s WOM distribution such that the decrease in WOM for articles with higher popularity (i.e., lower WOM rank) is much larger than the decrease in WOM for articles with lower popularity (i.e., higher WOM rank). It is noteworthy that the slope coefficient for LAT does not exhibit any significant changes before and after NYT’s paywall rollout, suggesting that the shift of NYT’s content sharing distribution is not caused by extraneous factors such as time trends. Therefore, we conclude that NYT’s content sharing distribution becomes less concentrated (a longer tail) after the paywall rollout. Potential Mechanisms for Long-Tail Effect Although our paper focuses on empirically examining the net impact of paywall on WOM pattern and does not isolate the impact of various alternative mechanisms that may lead to this net effect, given the data availability, we are able to perform\n",

Based on WOM Rank of Contenti, we create a user’s Average Rank of Content Shared at the user level. Average Rank of Content Sharedj is created by aggregating all of the articles shared by a user and then taking an average of the WOM Rank of Content measure for each article. The metric captures a user’s tendency to consume and share popular versus niche content. A lower mean reflects a user’s preference for sharing popular content. Then, we create User Rank for user j by sorting users based on the count of the total articles shared by each user in descending order (i.e., the highest sharer gets the lowest rank). As per the exposure theory-based conjecture, the paywall treatment effect is caused by reduced WOM behavior (or, in extreme cases, attrition) of a certain user segment that is more likely to consume popular content. In order to take into account the differential impact of a paywall with respect to user heterogeneity, we conduct a latent user segment analysis using finite mixture modeling. The purpose of our latent segment analysis is to identify latent user segments in terms of content sharing level and preference for content popularity.22 These segments can then be compared for difference in content consumption as well as attrition likelihoods after the paywall is introduced. The finite mixture of a normal regression model captures the differences between light and heavy user segments in the consumption of head and tail content in the content sharing distribution. The S-segment finite mixture model is specified as follows:\n",

            "Table 8 reports the parameter estimates for the two-segment model.23 Based on the estimated coefficients and segment weights in Table 8, we conducted post-estimation to determine each subject’s segment membership. Tables 9 indicates that segment 1 is comprised of the light users who read less and are more likely to read popular content, whereas segment 2 is composed of the heavy users who read more and less popular (a mix of niche and popular) content. This finding supports the underlying assumption about the relationship between a user’s content consumption intensity and preference for popular versus niche content. Another assumption that exposure theory-based mechanism relies on is that light user segments (who can be argued to have low WTP) are more likely to reduce (or even discontinue, in extreme cases) their consumption of NYT content after the paywall implementation. Although a paired t-test analysis shows that NYT users reduce the volume of their reading/sharing after introduction of the paywall (pre-paywall mean: 4.70, post-paywall mean: 4.09, t = 11.51, p-value < 0.01), and while there is no statistically significant difference in LAT users’ reading/sharing volume (pre-paywall mean: 4.60, post-paywall mean: 4.52, t = 1.19, p-value = 0.23), it is difficult to cleanly attribute any reduction in consumption by the light user segment to the paywall due to the nature of the data. Specifically, the result are likely to be confounded due to the noisy measurement of variable capturing the change in the content consumption by light users after the paywall as the light user segment has a more dispersed sharing pattern (due to their low overall sharing) and therefore any change in their behavior may not be captured accurately within a short time period. We acknowledge the data limitation and concern about the reliability of the inferences based on such data; however, given that the purpose of this post hoc test is not to establish causality but to provide preliminary support for the plausibility of the assumptions underlying one of the proposed alternative mechanisms, we conduct an analysis to examine if these two segments differ in terms of their content consumption (i.e., reading/sharing) after the paywall is introduced. To reduce the impact of noise in the data, we create a categorical dependent variable, rather than continuous variable, to measure the reduction in consumption. This variable, referred to as ReducedConsumptionj , is created by comparing users in the pre- and post-paywall samples and is coded as 1 if a user shared content before the paywall rollout and did not share content after the paywall rollout. For those users who shared content both before and after the paywall rollout, the ReducedConsumptionj variable is coded as 0. Then we conduct a two-sample proportion test to examine which segment\n",

In other words, these descriptive statistics support that users classified as reducing consumption after introduction of the paywall are more likely to be light users. Finally, while we provide indirect support for the assumptions underlying the exposure theory-based mechanism, due to lack of data, we cannot rule out the search theory-based mechanism identified in the theory section.

Retweet ratiot represents the proportion of retweets among daily gross tweets messages. ln(Rival website visitst) and Retweet ratiot are the excluded exogenous variables that help us estimate the equations. The dummy variables, Saturdayt and Sundayt, are included in all equations to control for variations in the content and user reading behavior during weekends. Table 12 presents the estimation results for the 3SLS model. We find that the coefficients of ln(WOMt) (α1 = 0.3724; p < 0.01) and ln(WOMt-1) (α2 = 3.80e-06; p < 0.1) are positive and significant in the website traffic equation, suggesting that there is a positive relationship between the volume of online WOM (i.e., social media buzz) and website traffic. We now turn to an examination of the impact of a paywall on such interdependence. The results also show that both Paywall (α4 = !0.0807; p < 0.01) and the interaction of Paywall and ln(WOMt) (α5 = !0.129; p < 0.1) are negative and statistically significant. We plot the interaction between paywall and WOM volume. Figure 4 shows that the magnitude of WOM’s effect on website traffic generation decreases after NYT’s paywall, suggesting that the association of the volume of online WOM (i.e., social media buzz) with website traffic is weakened after a paywall introduction. The results provide evidence that social WOM is a significant predictor of website traffic; however, a firm’s information pricing changes these dynamics. We now turn to a discussion of the effect of a paywall on the counterfactual in our control group (i.e., LAT), which we used to alleviate any confounding factors associated with the timing of the NYT paywall implementation. As expected, our results for the same analysis using the LAT sample show that the interaction term between paywall and WOM volume has no significant effect on LAT’s website traffic. Furthermore, consistent with our main results from the NYT sample, the volume of WOM on Twitter has a positive and significant effect on website traffic generation (α1 = 0.589; p < 0.01), providing additional empirical support for our prior result that online WOM volume is positively related to website traffic. Economic Significance We examine the economic impact of WOM on website traffic and the impact of a paywall on this relationship using their marginal effects. As reported in Table 3, the average Website visits is 1,709,428 in the pre-paywall period.

However, after NYT’s paywall implementation, the same one-standard deviation increase in WOM volume in the previous period increase of website traffic in the current period by only 2.3 percent. Robustness Tests To address any concern about the validity of the time series instrument and the order of lagged variables, we conduct the subsample analysis using a vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables (VARX) and compare the contribution of WOM on website traffic generation before and after NYT’s paywall rollout. VARX is well suited to capture the dynamic interactions between WOM and website traffic over time (Luo et al. 2013). We find that the optimal lag length of the VARX model is 1, according to the Schwartz’s Bayesian Information Criterion (SBIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Similar to 3SLS results, the results for VARX show that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between WOM volume and website traffic before NYT’s paywall rollout; however, this interdependence becomes insignificant after the paywall rollout. The detailed model specification and results are reported in Appendix E. Potential Mechanisms for Impact of Paywall on WOM Effectiveness In the theory section, we identified three potential mechanisms (i.e., bypass, virality, and user resentment) that may affect WOM effectiveness after paywall. Given the results that show a decrease in the strength of the positive relationship between social media WOM and website traffic after a paywall implementation, we can conclude that the role of the bypass mechanism (and other such mechanisms), which should theoretically have a positive impact on WOM effec-\n",

            "tiveness is either nonexistent or relatively weaker than the impact of mechanisms such as virality effect and user resentment effect, which have a negative impact on WOM effectiveness. We indirectly find support for the virality effect as a plausible mechanism affecting WOM effectiveness. First, the results are consistent with the prediction of virality mechanism. Second, we find support for the assumptions of the mechanism that require disproportionate decrease in WOM about popular content, after the paywall, as our results suggest that the paywall creates a long tail of content distribution such that popular content sharing drops significantly. Further, as discussed in the “Volume of WOM: Differences-in-Differences Approach” section, the split sample analyses of original tweet and retweet only samples (Table 6) show lowered retweeting behavior, indirectly supporting the reduced effectiveness of WOM after introduction of the paywall. Finally, recall we suggested that a proportion of NYT readers may boycott the NYT and “stop clicking on NYT links in social media” due to negative emotional response, such as resentment toward the paywall. If this were the case, we would expect the lowered effectiveness of NYT WOM after introduction of the paywall. In the present study, we cannot directly either support or rule out the resentment-based explanation for the impact of the paywall on NYT WOM effectiveness because we did not explicitly measure user resentment in our study. In summary, we find support for the virality mechanism; however, our paper cannot isolate the relative impact of virality versus resentment mechanism on the relationship between social media WOM and website traffic. As mentioned earlier, this calls for follow-up research examining the plausibility of the resentment mechanism.\n",

            "Discussion\n",
            "Using NYT’s paywall rollout as a natural experiment, our study finds that the introduction of the paywall influences the pattern and effectiveness of WOM on Twitter. Analyzing the pattern of WOM, we find that the volume of WOM for NYT’s content drops significantly after the paywall is introduced, but the paywall (i.e., charging for content that was earlier available for free) has a disproportionate impact on volume of WOM for content that differs in terms of content popularity, creating a longer tail in the WOM (i.e., content sharing distribution). Specifically, the volume of WOM about popular content decreases more significantly than the volume of WOM about niche content. Although we identify multiple mechanisms that may explain the long-tail effect due to the paywall, given the data availability, we are able to test the assumptions underlying only one of the mechanisms. Specifically, we examine the plausibility of the exposure theory-based mechanism by conducting a latent segment analysis. The results show that because of low WTP for content, light users consuming popular content have higher likelihoods of reduced WOM behavior than heavy users consuming a mix of niche and popular articles, thus reshaping the WOM distribution. The results suggest that the exposure theory-based mechanism is one of the plausible mechanisms that create the long tail effect after the paywall is introduced. To ensure that these results are not affected by extraneous confounding factors, we employed a difference-in-difference approach by comparing the WOM pattern for another newspaper (i.e., LAT) before and after NYT implemented its paywall. The absence of any significant change in the content pattern for LAT provides support for the impact of a paywall on the long-tail distribution of the WOM for NYT content within the Twitter platform. Given that we use the secondary data of WOM on Twitter (i.e., content sharing), we conducted an online user survey to support our use of content sharing as a proxy for actual content consumption and find a positive and significant correlation between reading and sharing on Twitter. The long-tail results combined with the online survey help us understand how the introduction of a paywall affects the content demand patterns among news articles. We chose Twitter as our empirical context because of the feasibility of collecting population-sized news article link sharing. However, we also find a positive and significant correlation between reading and sharing on Facebook, supporting the fact that news article sharing behavior on Twitter would be qualitatively similar to content sharing behavior on Facebook or other social media platforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Further, our analysis, examining the impact of a paywall on the effectiveness of online WOM in increasing the newspaper’s website traffic, shows that paywalls have a negative impact on WOM effectiveness. First, our findings show that WOM within Twitter leads to website traffic. The role of WOM on website traffic generation is a long-time speculation. However, our study is one of few that empirically demonstrate this relationship. Further, we find that this positive relationship between WOM volume and website traffic weakens significantly after the introduction of NYT’s paywall, whereas the strength of the relationship between WOM and website traffic for LAT, which served as the counterfactual, did not vary during the same time period. These results show that a paywall negatively moderates the relationship between WOM and website traffic, providing implications for online advertising revenue. The findings of this study offer novel and important implications for the literature on strategic use of social media and paywall.\n",

            "Theoretical Implications\n",
            "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines how a firm’s decision about a paywall implementation affects the distributional pattern of WOM about information content (such as news) consumption and its further impact on WOM effectiveness. This paper makes four important theoretical contributions. First, our study informs the information goods pricing literature. Specifically, we argue and empirically validate that shifting from free to for-a-fee pricing may weaken the impact of a WOM promotion strategy. We complement the extant research in the information goods pricing literature by proposing and empirically showing the significant interplay between a paywall strategy and its WOM pattern as well as WOM effectiveness. Prior work on information pricing has primarily examined, mostly analytically, the interaction between information pricing and product strategies (Bakos and Brynjolfsson 1999; Chen and Seshadri 2007; Choudhary 2010; Wu et al. 2008). We conduct an empirical study that shows the impact of a paywall on WOM pattern, which is part of a firm’s promotion strategy and has implications for the firm’s product strategy. Another implication of these results is that researchers developing analytical models to understand alternative pricing strategies for information goods need to take into account the impact of such pricing on the online WOM, which in turn determines the potential demand for content and revenue. Incorporating the effects of different\n",

            "pricing policies on word-of-mouth pattern and effectiveness in analytical models will provide a more realistic assessment of the impact of pricing policies on firm performance. Second, our study contributes to the WOM literature by examining both the pattern and effectiveness of WOM via social media. Given that the WOM dynamics can be affected by firms’ strategies in other domains such as information pricing, researchers studying WOM pattern, diffusion, and effectiveness should pay attention to such forces by identifying and controlling them in their empirical studies. Our study also extends the WOM literature by highlighting that the distribution of WOM for hit/niche content may change as a result of a change in paywall strategy. Further, complementing the studies that measure the impact of online WOM on various measures related to financial performance such as product adoption and sales (Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006; Godes and Maylin, 2004; Liu 2006), we suggest that WOM has a positive impact on the newspaper’s website traffic, which is a critical factor influencing financial performance. We also extend this research stream by highlighting the role of a paywall strategy in moderating the impact of WOM on performance outcome (i.e., website traffic). Third, we contribute to the theory of exposure and variety seeking. The results from the finite mixture model analysis provide indirect empirical support for the notion that those users who have high consumption levels seek more variety and are more likely to consume products that are less popular vis-à-vis those users who have low consumption levels. Fourth, our study extends the literature examining various aspects of long-tail phenomenon, especially in the online context. Prior literature has focused on the extent of the long tail for physical products (Brynjolfsson et al. 2010) and studied the impact of information technology on the long tail in the distribution of product sales (Brynjolfsson et al. 2011; Brynjolfsson et al. 2003). However, an important but underinvestigated topic is the long tail effect in the context of information goods (digital content) where Internet and digitization technologies tend to have significant impacts on consumers’ consumption patterns (e.g., subscription-based online music services, Elberse 2008). Furthermore, to our knowledge, little research has examined non-technology drivers, such as firm strategies, on the long tail consumption patterns of information. Our study fills this research gap by examining the impact of a paywall on the long tail in the distribution of online WOM for information goods such as newspaper articles. This study is in line with recent literature on the online long tail effect that examines, for instance, the impact of social media buzz on music consumption patterns (Dewan and Ramaprasad 2012) and the role of product popularity on consumer choice and sales distribution (Elberse\n",
            "\n",
            "2008). Our work enriches this stream of research by highlighting that a firm’s introduction of a paywall can be a demand side driver of long-tail outcomes (Brynjolfsson et al. 2010).\n",
            "\n",
            "Managerial Implications\n",
            "Our findings not only have the potential to enrich the stream of research on strategic use of social media, but also provide managerial implications for firms’ product and promotion strategies. This study provides several managerial implications for content providers in general and online newspaper publishers in particular. First, our results suggest that a content publisher that has implemented a paywall should be aware of its impact on changes in content consumption and sharing distribution. A firm should not only look at the direct cost–benefits of different pricing alternatives but also examine the indirect effects of pricing on revenue through the changes in the pattern and effectiveness of WOM. Second, our results provide support to practitioners’ belief that online WOM plays an important role in the firm’s performance. Through a set of rigorous empirical tests, we show that online WOM does matter in terms of increasing a firm’s website traffic. We also find support for common intuition that moving from a free to a for-a-fee pricing model will lead to a decrease in WOM as well as website traffic (due to a drop in the number of existing customers). Of greater importance, we also suggest that, in spite of a company’s strategy to encourage WOM (e.g., excluding the content accessed through WOM from the NYT’s paywall), the introduction of a paywall may not only lower the WOM but also weaken its power to bring more website traffic. These results suggest that companies need to measure and manage the impact of a firm’s strategy on WOM. To achieve this objective, a company may need to invest in information systems that capture, monitor, and analyze the clickstream data from their webservers as well as WOM data from social media platforms such as Twitter. Further, managers may need to actively manage the WOM dynamics, especially during periods of shift in firm strategies. Third, a content provider should note the implications of our long-tail results (i.e., a paywall is more likely to reduce popular content consumption/sharing) in developing its product and promotion strategies. After paywall implementation by a firm, social transmission of its content may become less viral, thus lowering the effectiveness of WOM in generating website traffic. This negative influence of a paywall on the firm’s website traffic in turn lowers the online advertising revenue, which is a function of website traffic.\n",

            "\n",
            "The observation that the introduction of a paywall might shift the distribution in the consumption and sharing of information content implies that a company’s product strategy may also need to be reexamined when implementing a new paywall strategy. Specifically, our results suggest that a shift from free to for-a-fee pricing should be followed by a concurrent shift in the company’s product assortment strategy such that the company focuses more on producing and promoting niche content vis-à-vis popular content. However, if the company considers it important to have popular content in its product mix for strategic reasons (e.g., NYT may want to ensure its brand image as an opinion leader for both popular as well as niche content), then the company may experiment with unbundling its content and keep the popular content free while charging for niche content. For example, a content provider may offer “most e-mailed articles” for free to increase website traffic generated through social media, while gaining subscription revenue from loyal consumers who consume more niche content. Such a pricing strategy would lower the detrimental impact of pricing on WOM for popular content and help mitigate a concern regarding the sustainability of NYT’s image as an opinion leader and an influential mainstream newspaper even after the paywall implementation. Finally, our long-tail results show that if a company starts charging fees for its information content, product variety and niche content becomes more important. Companies that provide mostly popular information content need to be cautious in their content pricing decision because the negative influence of a paywall on the firm’s website traffic can significantly lower online advertising revenue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, caution should be taken in generalizing our findings because of the fact that NYT was among the first to implement a paywall. It is possible that consumers may become accustomed to paid subscription models over time. Thus, the behavior of consumers in response to similar price strategies by late movers may be different, leading to different WOM dynamics. However, we believe that this first mover effect can only impact the magnitude of our findings. Based on our theory, if consumers become more comfortable with the idea of paying for information goods, the proportion of light users that drop after the paywall is introduced will be smaller and consequently the drop in volume of WOM for popular content will also be relatively low, weakening the long-tail pattern of WOM that we observed in our NYT data. In such a case, we expect that our theoretical explanation of user preference for product variety and the resulting long tail-pattern would hold, although the magnitude of effects will be smaller. Future research on later adoption of a paywall would provide more salient implications for firms considering a paywall strategy. Third, although our empirical study is based on news content, which is a type of information good, we believe that the underlying theory and observed results would hold for other information goods as well. However, the magnitude of the effect and importance as well as the relevance of online WOM in social media may differ across different types of information goods such as music, movies, software, etc. It may be a fruitful avenue for future research to replicate this study for different information goods. Finally, in order to make fair comparisons of WOM volume among the articles that have longer (less) duration and thus have greater (lower) chances to be shared, we used 1-day diffusion window in our analysis. Given the fast diffusion of news articles on Twitter (Goel et al. 2012, Kwark et al. 2010), this measure would be representative. However, an examination of whether there is disturbance to the natural decay in WOM for NYT compared to the counterfactual of the LAT control group would provide interesting additional insights. Therefore, future research could develop a method to estimate a decay function of the shelf life of a news article to compare WOM dynamics for old and current news articles (e.g., drivers of immediate and ongoing WOM, Berger and Schwartz 2011).\n",
            "\n",
            "Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research\n",
            "Given the nature of empirical research, this study also has a few limitations that could be addressed in future research. First, NYT’s paywall, used as the treatment of our natural experiment, was implemented as a single pricing strategy. As such, depending on the design of information pricing policies (e.g., NYT’s single pricing strategy versus online The Wall Street Journal’s online content-based pricing), the magnitude of the paywall effect may vary; however, the implications of the paywall adoption on WOM diffusion patterns would provide insights to understand different pricing schemes of digital goods. Given that NYT and other content providers are currently introducing new pricing strategies (e.g., plans for iPhone and iPad apps), future research could provide interesting insights by comparing our results with the impact of such changes.\n",

In this study, we leverage WOM data collected from social media platforms and complement it with aggregated clickthough data to understand how a firm’s shift in information pricing, such as introduction of a paywall, affects its WOM dynamics. We hope that our work will contribute to and promote future research that enhances our understanding of consumer behavior and digital markets regarding paid content.\n",

Based on WTP and Exposure Theory A1a Rationale/Arguments/ Assumptions Light user segments (who are likely to have low WTP) are more likely to reduce (or even discontinue in extreme cases) their consumption of NYT content after the paywall implementation. Light user segments are more likely to consume popular articles whereas the heavy user segment is more likely to consume a mix of niche articles and popular content. Light user segments (who are likely to have low WTP) are more likely to reduce (or even discontinue in extreme cases) their consumption of NYT content after the paywall implementation. Search cost for finding popular content is lower than the search cost for finding niche content. Connected Literature/Theory Utility theory — WTP (Danaher 2002) Resulting (Possible) Effect Juxtaposing A1a and A1b leads to long tail effect due to the disproportionate reduction of popular content consumption (as a results of reduction of content consumption by light users). Support for/Against A1a. Supported (see the descriptive statistics in Table 11). A1b. Supported (see results from the postestimation of finite mixture model in Table 9) Since the resulting effects as well as both the assumptions (A1a and A1b) are supported, we suggest that there is support for this mechanism.\n",

This mechanism does not suggest that there will be a differential impact of paywall on the content consumption of light and heavy users. Though we do not test assumption A4b, however, we find that consistent with exposure based mechanism light users reduce their content consumption more than heavy users after paywall (see Table 10), which cannot be explained by this mechanism. So we infer that this mechanism may have relatively weak role, if any.\n",

            "B. Impact of Paywall on WOM Effectiveness Alternative Mechanisms B1. Bypass effect B1a Rationale/Arguments/ Assumptions NYT allows visitors who come from links on social media to bypass its paywall. This bypass effect (i.e., increase in NYT non-subscribers’ likelihood to click on a NYT content available through social media as they attempt to maximize the number of articles that can be accessed without paying subscription fee) may be dominant in website traffic generation. Given that popular articles are the content that has a greater demand from a larger audience (Zentner et al. 2013), we expect that a decrease in the proportion of WOM about popular content will in turn lower the average clicks per link shared through social WOM. Due to negative emotional response toward the paywall, a proportion of NYT readers may boycott the NYT and systematically do not click on and/or share NYT link on social media. Underlying Theory/Rationale Related to the Design of the Paywall mechanism Resulting (Possible) Effect The relative strength of the positive relationship between social media WOM and website traffic may increase after a paywall implementation. Support for/Against Our study does not directly measure the bypass effect but given the results that show decrease in the strength of the positive relationship between social media WOM and website trafficafter a paywall implementation, we can assume that role of such mechanism, if any, is small.\n",

By considering 14 properties of mixed-methods research (e.g., purposes, research questions, epistemological assumptions), our guidelines demonstrate how researchers can flexibly identify the existing variations in mixed-methods research and proceed accordingly with a study design that suits their needs. To make the guidelines actionable for various situations and issues that researchers could encounter, we develop a decision tree to map the flow and relationship among the design strategies. We also illustrate one possible type of mixed-methods research in information systems in depth and discuss how to develop and validate metainferences as the outcomes of such a study.

            "Mixed-methods research 1 (i.e., research that combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research approaches) has gained popularity as a method of choice for studying phenomena in information systems (IS) research (e.g., Bhattacherjee & Premkumar, 2004; Keil & Tiwana, 2006; Koh, Ang, & Straub, 2004). Mixed-methods research provides an opportunity to develop novel theoretical perspectives by combining the strengths of quantitative and qualitative methods. Thus, it provides rich insights by overcoming limitations associated with either method alone and results in “meta-inferences”—an integrative view of findings from qualitative and quantitative strands of mixed-methods research (Creswell, 2009; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003; Venkatesh, Brown, & Bala, 2013). However, the application of this method in the IS field has been quite limited (see Venkatesh et al., 2013). The different paradigms underlying the knowledge about research methodology have constrained IS scholars’ contributions to understanding business phenomena using mixed-methods research (Greene & Caracelli, 2003; Petter & Gallivan, 2004; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003; Venkatesh et al., 2013). Venkatesh et al. (2013) suggest that IS researchers could collaborate to leverage different paradigmatic views and, at the same time, conduct rigorous mixed-methods research because, with it, one can embrace diverse methodological approaches and, thus, reduce the tension between different paradigms (Ågerfalk, 2013). Despite a need for IS research to bridge the gap between different paradigms and/or methods, IS researchers have provided no real mixed-methods guidelines in the emerging paradigms in the IS field. In response to this need, Venkatesh et al. (2013) developed a set of guidelines for conducting mixed-methods research and illustrated the applicability of these guidelines using two published IS papers. Although their guidelines focus on the different types of mixed-methods research by identifying possible combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods, they discuss only the time ordering of the qualitative and quantitative methods in a single research inquiry and focus less on how to design different types of mixed-methods studies based on various criteria (e.g., priority, stage of integration, epistemological perspective). Early approaches to mixed-methods designs (e.g., Creswell, 2003; Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003b) have been primarily typological (Maxwell & Loomis, 2003). For example, Creswell (2003) identify two basic types of mixed-methods designs: concurrent and sequential. Although a typological approach of mixed-methods research could help researchers select a particular design for their study (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003), mixed-methods studies have a far greater diversity than any single typology can actually capture (Caracelli & Greene, 1997; Guest, 2012; Maxwell & Loomis, 2003; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003b). In particular, the existence of more than two paradigms (e.g., positivist, critical realist, postpositivist), the diversity of qualitative and quantitative approaches that one can employ, the wide range of purposes of mixed-methods research, and differences with respect to time orientation have made actually using a mixed-methods design far more complicated than simply fitting it in a typology framework (Maxwell & Loomis, 2003). Consistent with Maxwell and Loomis (2003), we believe that one can use a more flexible approach to mixed-methods research designs to address the limitations of the typology approach. Thus, rather than categorizing mixed-methods designs into a typology framework, we view the design of a study as comprising several different dimensions (from many different typologies) that researchers can flexibly integrate to meet their studies’ purposes. Against this backdrop, we augment the mixed-methods guidelines that Venkatesh et al. (2013) propose by leveraging variations in mixed-methods research. Instead of focusing on one typology or framework, we approach mixed-methods designs by identifying different properties or typologies of mixed-methods research. We provide guidelines that are flexible enough to accommodate different types of mixed-methods research. By considering different properties of mixed-methods research (e.g., purposes, research questions, epistemological assumptions), our guidelines demonstrate how researchers can flexibly identify the existing variations in mixed-methods research and proceed accordingly with a study design that suits their needs (see Maxwell, 1996; Maxwell & Loomis, 2003; Nastasi, Hitchcock, & Brown, 2010).

            "Although researchers have used the terms mixed methods and multimethod interchangeably in social and behavioral science, the two do differ conceptually (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003) identify two major types of multiple methods research: 1) mixed-methods research and 2) multi-method research. In mixed-methods research, one uses quantitative and qualitative data-collection procedures (e.g., survey and focus group interviews) or research methods (e.g., ethnography and field experiment) to answer the research questions (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003a). In contrast, in multi-method research, one addresses the research questions by using two or more quantitative data-collection procedures or research methods (e.g., survey and experiment) or two or more qualitative data-collection procedures or research methods (e.g., ethnography and case study) (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). Mixed-methods research requires a combination of qualitative and quantitative procedures, whereas multimethod research requires a combination of qualitative or quantitative procedures.\n",

            "we comprehensively illustrate how to apply a mixed-methods approach based on different properties of mixed-methods research. We also discuss how to develop and validate meta-inferences as the outcomes of a mixed-methods research project. Bryman (2006), as cited in Harrison and Reilly (2011), found that scholars have had a difficult time in identifying exemplary mixed-methods research due to the absence of best practice templates from which to draw on when it comes to triangulating the findings. By illustrating how to develop and validate meta-inferences, we highlight a key advantage of mixed-methods research over a single method design. This paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we summarize mixed-methods research and overview the guidelines for mixed-methods research that Venkatesh et al. (2013) propose. In Section 3, we discuss the variations in mixed-methods research, leverage them to extend Venkatesh et al.’s (2013) guidelines, and present a decision tree to map the flow and relationship among the design strategies. In Section 4, we offer an illustrative study of one possible type of mixed-methods research and concomitant meta-inferences. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude the paper with implications and suggestions for future research.\n",

            "In general, one can categorize research in the social sciences into three groups: 1) qualitative research (i.e., research dominated by, but not exclusively based on, constructive paradigms and focused on analyzing narrative data) (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003b); 2) quantitative research (i.e., research dominated by positivist paradigms and focused on analyzing numerical data) (Orlikowski & Baroudi, 1991); and 3) mixed-methods research (i.e., research dominated by other paradigms, such as pragmatism, critical realism, and transformative-emancipatory and focused on analyzing both narrative and numerical data) (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). Scholars have defined the concept of mixed-methods research in several ways. In an effort to precisely define mixed-methods research, Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, and Turner (2007) review various definitions for the term. Based on their review, they define mixed-methods research as: the type of research in which a researcher or team of researchers combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research approaches (e.g., use of qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, data collection, analysis, inference techniques) for the broad purposes of breadth and depth of understanding and corroboration. (p. 123) This definition suggests that mixed-methods research can involve mixing two or more different methods “within a single study” or “within a program of research” and that “mixing [methods] might occur across a closely related set of studies” (Johnson et al., 2007, p. 123). Researchers have identified three advantages of mixed-methods research: 1) it enables researchers to simultaneously address confirmatory and explanatory research questions and, therefore, evaluate and generate theory at the same time; 2) it enables researchers to provide stronger inferences than a single method or worldview; and 3) it provides an opportunity for researchers to produce a greater assortment of divergent and/or complementary views (see Venkatesh et al., 2013). When used in combination, quantitative and qualitative methods complement each other and allow for a more robust analysis (Ivankova, Creswell, & Stick, 2006; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008). However, mixed-methods research does not replace either a quantitative or a qualitative approach but rather draws from the strengths and minimizes the weaknesses of both methods (Creswell, 2003; Jick, 1979; Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Venkatesh et al., 2013). Venkatesh et al. (2013) have proposed the most recent guidelines for conducting mixed-methods research. They divide their guidelines into two major areas: 1) general guidelines (i.e., appropriateness of mixedmethods research and meta-inferences) (Steps 1 to 4) and 2) validation (Steps 5 to 6). We summarize the guidelines next.\n",

            "At the initial stage of their study, researchers should carefully think about their research questions, purposes, paradigmatic views, and contexts to decide on the appropriateness of a mixed-methods approach. In mixedmethods research, research questions (or research objectives) drive the methods used in the study and set boundaries on the research project. Researchers should employ a mixed-methods design only when they intend to holistically explain a phenomenon for which extant research is fragmented, inconclusive, and/or equivocal.\n",

A strong inference is only possible if one has a well-implemented design that is appropriate for the research question. Thus, researchers must determine which research design is most suitable to address their research question(s) and derive their studies’ meta-inferences or conclusions based on the design they select.\n",

            "Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003) propose the term inference quality to refer to issues associated with validity in the context of mixed-methods research. According to Teddlie and Tashakkori, a mixed-methods nomenclature for validation can help differentiate mixed-methods validation from quantitative and qualitative validation (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Thus, consistent with Teddlie and Tashakkori, we use the umbrella term inference quality to refer to validity in mixed-methods research. Venkatesh et al. (2013) propose four stages of assessing the quality of meta-inferences: 1) discuss quality criteria in quantitative and qualitative research, 2) use mixed-methods research nomenclature when discussing inference quality, 3) discuss quality of mixed-methods findings and/or meta-inferences (i.e., explanatory quality), and 4) discuss quality from a research design point of view (i.e., design quality). To assess the quality of inferences, one should assess each component of the study using criteria appropriate for its methodology. Only after one has done this step can one apply the quality assessment of the mixed-methods study to evaluate the quality of meta-inferences.\n",

Further, although some researchers have previously attempted to integrate different properties of mixed-methods research (e.g., Maxwell & Loomis, 2003; Nastasi et al., 2010), existing mixed methods do not elaborate on different design variations and the relationships among them. Thus, we extend Venkatesh et al.’s (2013) guidelines by integrating different properties of mixedmethods research into the guidelines. Identifying how different properties are related and determining how one design decision may lead to another decision will help researchers develop a high-quality mixedmethods study (Guest, 2012; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003b). To integrate the design variations that encompass the existing typologies, we reviewed the literature in depth and discussed different variations of mixed-methods research based on the existing typologies in mixed-methods research.

            "\n",
            "Mixed-methods research questions differ from those of qualitative and quantitative research questions. Quantitative research questions tend to be specific in nature (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006). Most quantitative research questions are descriptive (i.e., they simply call for quantifying responses to one or more variables; for example, what is the perception of ease of use of PCs?), comparative (i.e., they call for comparing two or more groups on some outcome variables) (e.g., what is the difference in purchase behaviors between adopters and non-adopters?), or associative (i.e., they deal with trends between (or among) two (or more) variables; for example, what is the nature of the relationship between the intention to adopt and subsequent purchase behavior?) (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006). In contrast, qualitative research questions are more “open-ended, evolving, and non-directional” (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006, p. 482). Good qualitative questions are broad but specific enough to focus on the issues most relevant to the individuals under investigation (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010). Qualitative questions generally tend to seek, discover, and explore a process or to describe experiences (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006). Referencing Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2006), Creswell (1998) argues that qualitative research questions can either represent broad questions (e.g., how have new adopters’ attitudes toward technology or personal computers evolved as they used the technology every day?) or specific subquestions that address major concerns and complexities that one seeks to resolve (e.g., what does it mean to nonadopters to change their attitudes toward the technology?). The major difference between quantitative and qualitative research questions is that one generally develops quantitative research questions before the study begins; in contrast, one generally develops qualitative questions at the beginning of the study or they emerge at some point throughout the study (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006). Unlike qualitative or quantitative research questions, mixed-methods research questions are “questions that embed both a quantitative research question and a qualitative research question within the same question” (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006, p. 483). Mixed-methods questions determine one’s primary design strategies, including whether one should collect and analyze qualitative data and quantitative data concurrently, sequentially, or iteratively before addressing the questions (Tashakkori & Creswell, 2007). Plano Clark and Badiee (2010) identify four dimensions that describe how researchers can write research questions in the context of their mixed-methods studies: 1) rhetorical style—question format, 2) rhetorical style—level of integration, 3) the relationship of questions to other questions, and 4) the relationships of questions to the research process. One can state a research question based on the first dimension (i.e., rhetorical style—question format) in three different formats: 1) question (researchers write an interrogative sentence complete with a question mark), 2) aim (researchers write a declarative sentence as an expression of research objectives), and 3) hypothesis (researchers write a statement that predicts an outcome for a research question) (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010). Based on the second dimension (i.e., rhetorical style—level of integration), one can write research questions in a mixed-methods study as described by Creswell (2009) in three ways. First, one can independently write quantitative questions and qualitative questions. For example, in a study of online friendship, a quantitative question might be “what is the relationship between online friendship and happiness?” and a qualitative question might be “what factors play a role in meaningful online friendship?” (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010). Second, researchers can write separate quantitative questions and/or qualitative questions and supplement them with mixed-methods questions. For example, one qualitative question is “what theory explains adolescents’ process of using social media?”, one quantitative question is “how are the identified factors related?”, and one mixedmethods research question is “how do adolescents use social media?” (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010).

            "researchers can write only mixed-methods questions that reflect the procedures or the research content; for example: “how is an effective online community developed and tested?”. If researchers attempt to address more than one research question, they should address the third dimension (i.e., the relationship of questions to other questions) (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010). The relationship among the questions shapes a study’s overall design and informs the relationship between its quantitative and qualitative components (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010). Plano Clark and Badiee (2010) suggest two relationship alternatives: 1) research questions may be independent of each other and 2) one research question may depend on the results of other questions (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010). The last dimension focuses on the relationship of questions to the research process. Research questions in mixed-methods studies may be either predetermined or emergent (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010). A research question is predetermined when it appears at the beginning of the study based on researchers’ understanding of the literature and practice or disciplinary considerations. In contrast, one forms emergent questions during the design, data-collection, data-analysis, and/or interpretation phases of the research process (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010).\n",

(1989), Creswell (2003) and Tashakkori and Teddlie (2003b), we can summarize the purposes of mixed-methods research into seven categories: 1) complementarity (i.e., to gain complementary views about the same phenomena or relationships), 2) completeness (i.e., to gain a complete picture of phenomena), 3) developmental (i.e., to ensure the questions from one strand emerge from the inference of a previous one or one strand is used to develop hypotheses the researcher will test in the next one), 4) expansion (i.e., to explain or expand on the understanding obtained in a previous strand of a study), 5) corroboration/confirmation or triangulation (i.e., to assess the credibility of inferences obtained from one approach), 6) compensation (i.e., to eliminate potential design weaknesses of one approach by using the other), and 7) diversity (i.e., to obtain divergent views of the same phenomenon) (see Venkatesh et al., 2013).\n",

A single paradigm perspective proposes that one can accommodate both quantitative and qualitative research under the same paradigm (e.g., positivist, realist) (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). A multiple paradigm perspective claims that alternative paradigms are compatible and can be used in one research project (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). One can view combining multiple paradigms and methodological practices as a strategy that adds rigor, breadth complexity, richness, and depth to a research inquiry (Denzin, 2012). Under this multiple paradigm perspective, researchers have to decide which paradigms best fit their study given they choose to use a particular mixed-methods design (Creswell, Plano Clark, Gutmann, & Hanson, 2003).\n",

            "Although specific paradigms are commonly associated with specific methods, one may use both qualitative and quantitative methods appropriately with any research paradigm (Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Researchers have proposed several paradigms for mixed-methods research, such as the purist stance (i.e., because the assumptions of different paradigms are incompatible, it is not possible to mix paradigms in the same study), aparadigmatic stance (i.e., driven by research questions and/or purposes), substantive theory stance (i.e., emergent paradigms may be embedded in or intertwined with substantive theories) (Greene, 2007; Venkatesh et al., 2013), complementary strengths stance (i.e., the assumptions of different paradigms are not fundamentally compatible but are different in important ways), dialectic stance (i.e., important paradigm differences should be respectfully and intentionally used together to engage meaningfully with difference), and alternative paradigms stance (i.e., the initiation of a new paradigm that actively embraces and promotes the mixing of methods) (Greene, 2007). From our review, we found that mixed-methods researchers have mostly used the dialectic, alternative paradigms (i.e., pragmatism and critical realism) and complementary strengths stances (i.e., the use of multiple paradigms). The dialectic paradigm stance generally allows one to use more than one paradigmatic tradition in the same research project or research program because it assumes that using multiple paradigms contributes to better understanding the phenomenon under study (Greene & Hall, 2010; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003).

            "stance recognizes the legitimacy of multiple social inquiry theories and practices because they represent different ways of seeing and understanding the social world (Greene, 2005, 2007; Greene & Hall, 2010). A mixed-methods way of thinking under the dialectic paradigm offers researchers opportunities to meaningfully engage with difference as they encounter it in their studies (Greene & Hall, 2010). The alternative paradigms stance includes pragmatism and critical realism. One of the central ideas in pragmatism is that “engagement in philosophical activity should be done to address problems, not to build systems” (Biesta, 2010, p. 97). Pragmatism supports using both qualitative and quantitative research methods in the same research study or in multistage research programs (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). Because a pragmatist perspective considers practical consequences to be a crucial component of meaning and truth (Venkatesh et al., 2013), researchers need to articulate a purpose for their mixed-methods study to establish the rationale for why they need to mix quantitative and qualitative methods in the first place (Creswell, 2003). Critical realists believe that an objective reality exists but that we can understand it only imperfectly and probabilistically (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). They deny that we have any objective knowledge of the world and accept the possibility of alternative valid accounts of any phenomenon (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). Critical realism “embraces various methodological approaches from different philosophical positions by taking a critical stance towards the necessity and validity of current social arrangements without following the extant paradigms’ assumptions at face value” (Zachariadis, Scott, & Barret, 2013, p. 856). Thus, critical realism is an ideal paradigm for mixed-methods research because its philosophical stance is compatible with the methodological characteristics of both quantitative and qualitative research (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). Finally, according to the complementary strengths stance, one can combine and use other major paradigms used in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., constructivism/interpretivism, positivism, postpositivism) to support mixed-methods research. Constructivism/interpretivism believes that people construct their own understanding and subjective knowledge as they interact with the world around them (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003b). Thus, researchers who embrace this paradigm try to understand phenomena by accessing the meanings participants assign to them (Orlikowski & Baroudi, 1991). Phenomenological sociology, hermeneutics, and ethnography exemplify the constructivist approach (Lee, 1991). In contrast, positivism is premised on the existence of a priori fixed hypotheses or relationships among constructs that one typically investigates with structured instrumentation (Lee, 1991; Orlikowski & Baroudi, 1991). Whereas positivists believe that the researcher and the object of inquiry are independent of each other, postpositivists accept that theories and researchers’ backgrounds, knowledge, and values can influence the study (Trochim & Donnelly, 2007). One can conduct mixed-methods research by combining these paradigmatic approaches (Creswell et al., 2003; Lee, 1991). For example, researchers might use an ethnographic method to study system analysts and end users (Lee, 1991). Based on the results, researchers might use a positivist approach to formulate a formal, general theory that explains, for instance, end user resistance to systems analysis (Lee, 1991). In terms of conducting empirical mixed-methods studies, researchers should consider what the alternative paradigmatic positions are and determine which of the alternative positions best suits their studies (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010). When developing a mixed-methods study, one should begin by identifying paradigmatic assumptions, including their philosophical assumptions and theoretical framework, as research foundations that intertwine with the research questions and purposes of mixed-methods research.\n",

A monostrand study involves only a single phase of the conceptualization-experiential-inferential process, yet it consists of both qualitative and quantitative components (Nastasi et al., 2010; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). In contrast, mixedmethods multistrand designs contain at least two research strands (Bryman, 2006; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). In these designs, one can mix the quantitative and qualitative components in or across all stages (i.e., conceptualization-experiential-inferential process) of the study (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). Mixed-methods multistrand designs often involve multiple phases in a broader research program, with each phase encompassing all of the stages from conceptualization through inference (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). The decision related to strands/phases of research is important because it influences researchers’ decisions associated with other design strategies, such as the priority of methodological approach, mixing strategies, and time orientation. Naturally, monostrand designs have their constraints (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). In contrast, one can implement mixed-methods multistrand designs using parallel, sequential, conversion, or multilevel mixed designs (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).\n",

            "\n",
            "Based on the priority of the methodological approach, one can categorize mixed-methods research into equivalent-status designs and dominant-less dominant status designs. In equivalent-status designs, researchers generally conduct a study using both qualitative and quantitative approaches about equally to understand the phenomena of interest (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). In dominant-less dominant status designs, researchers usually conduct a study in a single dominant paradigm with a small component of the overall research project drawn from an alternative design (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). One can divide the dominant-less dominant status designs into two categories: qualitative-dominant mixedmethods research and quantitative-dominant mixed-methods research (Johnson et al., 2007). Qualitativedominant mixed-methods research refers to “the type of mixed research in which one relies on a qualitative, constructivist-poststructuralist-critical view of the research process, while concurrently recognizing that the addition of quantitative data and approaches are likely to benefit most research projects” (Johnson et al., 2007, p. 124). In contrast, quantitative-dominant mixed-methods research is “the type of mixed research in which one relies on a quantitative, postpositivist view of the research process, while concurrently recognizing that the addition of qualitative data and approaches are likely to benefit most research projects” (Johnson et al., 2007, p. 124). Although determining the priority of methodological approach is important, researchers can modify their priority decision after the study is complete (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). For example, a quantitativedominant mixed-methods study may become a qualitative dominant study if the qualitative data become more important in understanding the phenomenon under study and vice versa (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Despite this flexibility, we encourage researchers to refer to their research questions and purposes when deciding whether one component has significantly higher priority than does the other component.\n",

Using Patton’s (1990) typology of design dimensions, Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998) identify two different types of investigations in mixedmethods research: exploratory and confirmatory. In exploratory investigations, one conducts the study to develop or generate a new theory. These designs include qualitative case studies, experimental designs, and non-experimental studies. In contrast, in confirmatory investigations, one conducts the study to test an existing theory using hypotheses established a priori. These designs include naturalistic inquiry and quantitative explanatory studies, such as surveys (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).\n",

Teddlie and Tashakkori (2009) propose two dimensions of mixing strategies: fully mixed methods and partially mixed methods.

A fully mixed-methods design (also known as a mixed-model design) represents the highest degree of mixing paradigms in which one mixes the qualitative and quantitative paradigms at all or many steps of the study (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). In contrast, a partially mixed-methods design involves conducting a study in which one mixes the quantitative and qualitative portions of the study at specific stages, such as at the sampling, data-collection, data-analysis, or data-inference stages (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). In this design, one could mix their study’s quantitative and qualitative portions in a parallel manner, across chronological phases of the study, or across multiple levels of analysis (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).\n",

            "Based on its time orientation, one can categorize mixed-methods research into two types: sequential and concurrent. In sequential mixed-methods designs, researchers typically conduct one strand of the study (e.g., qualitative) first and then the other strand of the study (e.g., quantitative) (Creswell, 2003). The sequence depends on the objective of the study and the research questions. Creswell et al. (2003) propose three types of sequential mixed-methods designs: 1) sequential explanatory (i.e., this design is characterized by conducting the study’s quantitative phase followed by its qualitative phase), 2) sequential exploratory (i.e., this design is characterized by conducting the study’s qualitative phase followed by its quantitative phase), and 3) sequential transformative (i.e., one may prioritize either the quantitative or the qualitative phase and one will generally use a theoretical lens as an overarching perspective in the design that contains both quantitative and qualitative components to guide the study). A concurrent mixed-methods design is characterized by conducting the study’s qualitative and quantitative components during the same stage (Castro, Kellison, Boyd, & Kopak, 2010). This design uses both qualitative and quantitative data and analyses in independent strands to answer the research questions (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). Creswell et al. (2003) identify three types of concurrent mixed-methods designs: 1) concurrent triangulation (i.e., using both qualitative and quantitative data to accurately define relationships among variables of interest), 2) concurrent nested (i.e., a type of design in which one collects both qualitative and quantitative data concurrently but still gives one type of data weight over the other), and 3) concurrent transformative design (i.e., a type of design used to provide support for various perspectives in the context of social change or advocacy). One’s research questions and purposes for conducting mixedmethods research influence the decision associated with time orientation. For example, if one conducts a study to understand a phenomenon as it occurs, one should employ a concurrent mixed-methods design (Venkatesh et al., 2013). In contrast, if one conducts a study to identify and test theoretical constructs in a new context, one should employ a qualitative study followed by a quantitative study (Venkatesh et al., 2013).\n",

Before collecting data for their study, researchers should decide on the strategy to select the participants and the number of participants (i.e., sampling design strategies) (Collins, 2010).\n",

In mixed-methods investigations, researchers must make sampling decisions for both the qualitative and quantitative components of the study. Teddlie and Yu (2007) propose five different types of mixed-methods sampling strategies: 1) basic, 2) sequential, 3) concurrent, 4) multilevel, and 5) multiple. To the same end, Onwuegbuzie and Collins (2007) develop a framework for formulating sampling decisions in mixed-methods research based on 1) the time orientation of the component (i.e., simultaneous or sequential) and 2) the relationship between the qualitative and quantitative samples (i.e., identical versus parallel versus nested versus multilevel). Onwuegbuzie and Collin’s framework is similar to Teddlie and Yu’s strategies to the degree that one can categorize them into either sequential or concurrent mixed methods. We discuss four types of mixed-methods sampling designs by integrating these two typologies: basic, sequential, concurrent, and multiple sampling designs. Basic mixed-methods sampling strategies typically include probability sampling (i.e., researchers randomly select the sampling units that are representative of the population) (Collins, 2010), stratified purposive\n",

            "sampling (i.e., researchers first divide the group of interest into strata and then select a small number of cases to study intensively in each strata using a purposive sampling technique), and purposive random sampling (i.e., researchers take a random sample of a small number of units from a much larger target population) (Teddlie & Yu, 2007). Probabilistic sampling designs are generally associated with quantitative studies, whereas purposive sampling designs are associated with qualitative studies (Collins, 2010), and one can use both probabilistic and purposive sampling in quantitative and qualitative studies (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007). Sequential sampling strategies typically involve using methodology and results from the first strand to inform the methodology employed in the second strand (Teddlie & Yu, 2007). According to Onwuegbuzie and Collins (2007), one can categorize sequential mixed-methods sampling designs based on their sampling strategies: 1) identical samples—the same sample members participate in both the qualitative and qualitative phases of the investigation, 2) parallel samples—the samples for the quantitative and qualitative components of the study are different but drawn from the same underlying population, 3) nested samples— the sample members selected for one phase of the study represent a subset of those participants chosen for the other component of the study, and 4) multilevel samples design—involves using two or more sets of samples obtained from different levels of the study (Collins et al., 2007). Concurrent sampling strategies allow researchers to triangulate the results from the separate quantitative and qualitative components of their research (Teddlie & Yu, 2007) and confirm, cross-validate, or corroborate their findings in a single study (Creswell et al., 2003). Like the sequential sampling designs, one can categorize the concurrent mixed-methods sampling strategies into four types of designs (see previous paragraph). Finally, multiple sampling strategies generally involve using more than one sampling technique, such as integrating a stratified purposive sampling with concurrent mixed-methods sampling (Teddlie & Yu, 2007).\n",

Mixedmethods data-collection strategies can be either quantitative (involves relatively planned “instruments” or predetermined questions for collecting data) or qualitative (mostly unstructured methods of collecting data for measurement or observation) (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Also, the type of data may be numeric or text, audio recording of participants’ voice, or written notes (Creswell, 2003). In a mixed-methods study, one must recognize that those data-collection strategies have their limitations and their strengths (Johnson & Turner, 2003). Therefore, researchers can use the strengths of one method to overcome the weaknesses of another method by using both in a research study (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004).\n",

            "Based on the order of data analysis, one can use three strategies to analyze data in mixed-methods research: 1) concurrent mixed analysis (one analyzes both qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously), 2) sequential qualitative-quantitative data analysis (one analyzes qualitative data then quantitative data), and 3) sequential quantitative-qualitative data analysis (one analyzes quantitative data then qualitative data) (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). One can use several analysis tools or methods for analyzing mixed-methods data (e.g., data reduction, data transformation, data correlation) (see Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004). One of the most common dataanalysis practices is data conversion or transformation (i.e., one converts qualitative data into numerical codes that one can represent statistically (quantized), or one converts quantitative data into narrative data that one can analyze qualitatively (qualitized)) (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). One can quantize qualitative data to integrate them with quantitative data to “answer research questions or test hypotheses addressing relationships between independent variables and dependent variables” (Fielding, 2012, p. 126). The quantizing practice also provides useful information by obtaining the numerical values of observations in addition to researchers’ narrative descriptions (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006; Sandelowski, 2000).\n",

            "In contrast, one can adopt qualitizing techniques if one seeks to extract more information from quantitative data or to confirm interpretations of those data (Sandelowski, 2000). We have fewer examples of qualitizing data than those of quantizing data (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). As Creswell and Plano Clark (2007, p. 188) in Teddlie and Tashakorri (2009) note: “More work needs to be done to expand the techniques for quantifying qualitative data and to develop the analysis options for such transformed data. Writers have written even less about transforming quantitative data into qualitative data. This area is ripe for researcher innovation and future research.”. One possible qualitizing technique is to take a distribution of numeric data on a single variable and then generate separate narrative categories based on the ranges of values in that distribution (i.e., cluster analysis) (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Joseph, Ng, Koh, and Ang (2012) in their study on IS career histories is one example of IS research that has used a qualitizing technique. The researchers used quantitative cluster analysis to identify distinct career paths in their quantitative data. Their analysis yielded three clusters of IS career paths: information technology, professional labor market, and secondary labor market career. This type of qualitizing is called narrative profile formation because it involves constructing qualitative profiles from quantitative data (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). In general, researchers may plan a decision to transform data before conducting their study, but they generally do it after collecting data (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). For example, in monostrand mixedmethods designs, researchers usually plan data transformation prior to the study because they generally collect only one type of data (either qualitative or quantitative data) and convert that type of data into the other and analyze them accordingly (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). Researchers can also do data transformation in multistrand designs depending on their methodological approach and/or the findings from each phase of their study. For example, if researchers prioritize collecting and analyzing qualitative data, they should perform a quantizing technique to help explain the qualitative results (Creswell, Fetters, & Ivankova, 2004). However, if one believes that the results of each strand of research are sufficient (based on the theoretical concepts), transforming the data might not significantly contribute to the findings. In most cases, data transformation occurs serendipitously (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). For example, researchers may determine that their interview data reveal emerging patterns that they can convert into numerical forms and analyze quantitatively. This practice allows researchers to more thoroughly analyze the data and, thereby, strengthen the inference quality (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). Whereas transforming data in mixed-methods research has several benefits, it also has several limitations and challenges. First, although qualitizing techniques can help researchers gain more insights from their quantitative data, one should use qualitizing techniques cautiously because such techniques might represent an overgeneralization of the observed numeric data (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). It is also possible that profiles emerging from qualitizing techniques yield an unrealistic representation (Sandelowski, 2000). Second, data transformation might cause one to lose depth and flexibility of data interpretation (Driscoll, ApiahYeboah, Salib, & Rupert, 2007). Qualitative data are generally multidimensional (i.e., they can provide insights into a host of interrelated conceptual themes during analysis). These themes are also flexible (i.e., researchers can revisit them during analysis in an iterative analytical process to help them recognize emergent patterns) (Bazeley, 2004). However, quantized data are usually fixed and unidimensional—they comprise a single set of responses that represent a conceptual category determined prior to data collection (Driscoll et al., 2007). To overcome this limitation, researchers have to be able to switch back and forth from a qualitative lens to a quantitative lens by revisiting qualitative data components associated with significant statistical findings (Driscoll et al., 2007). Further, researchers should always assess the conversion legitimation when their data analysis and designs involve data transformation (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006). The third challenge of data transformation comes from a quantitative research perspective. Quantitative researchers argue that quantized data are vulnerable to the problem of multicollinearity, wherein response categories are themselves linked to one another as a result of the coding strategy (Driscoll et al., 2007). Further, the need to collect and analyze qualitative data can force researchers to reduce their sample size, which can limit the kinds of statistical procedures that they can use to analyze data (Driscoll et al., 2007). To overcome the collinearity issue, researchers can use available statistical remedies (e.g., separating dichotomized codes derived from a single open-ended question in subsequent statistical analysis) (Driscoll et al., 2007). Moreover, if researchers cannot collect a sufficient sample size for accurate estimation, they should avoid doing data transformation.\n",

Given that meta-inferences are generally theoretical statements about a phenomenon, including its interrelated components and boundary conditions, the process of developing inferences is conceptually similar to the process of developing theory from observation (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Thus, one can develop inferences inductively, deductively, or abductively depending on the existence of theoretical foundations or conceptual frameworks underlying the study (Morse, 2010).\n",

            "When researchers use a mixed-methods approach to examine their research questions, they generally switch between different modes of generalizability (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). One can categorize these differences in generalizability concerns into four modes: inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998), the combination of inductive and deductive reasoning (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998), and abductive reasoning (Van de Ven, 2007). In inductive reasoning, researchers generally gather data from specific instances to build up a theory. Thus, inductive reasoning involves generalizing a theory confirmed in one specific setting to another context as the theory evolves (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). In general, one uses inductive theoretical reasoning in qualitative studies (Merriam, 1998). However, although qualitative studies mostly adopt inductive reasoning, some adopt deductive reasoning processes (Creswell, 2003). In deductive reasoning, researchers generally predict outcomes that are supposed to occur in a theoretical population. Thus, deductive reasoning involves making generalizations from a specific sample that one uses for that theoretical population (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Although a particular study may adopt either deductive or inductive theoretical reasoning, one will likely use both types of theoretical reasoning simultaneously in developing meta-inferences (Miller, 2003; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). According to pragmatism, mixed-methods researchers can select both the inductive and deductive logic and use them simultaneously in the course of conducting research that focuses on addressing research questions (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Finally, in abductive reasoning, (Van de Ven, 2007), researchers make a logical connection “between data and theory” and often use it to theorize “about a surprising event” (Feilzer, 2010, p. 10). In this reasoning, researchers move back and forth between theories and data: they “first convert observations into theories and then assess those theories through action” (Morgan, 2007, p. 71). This type of reasoning requires using different approaches to theory and data and offers great opportunity to triangulate inferences developed from qualitative and quantitative research (Feilzer, 2010; Morgan, 2007). Developing meta-inferences depends on research questions, specific methods employed, and empirical domains under investigation (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). Erzberger and Kelle (2003) suggest that researchers should always look for sufficient empirical evidence for their theoretical statements and avoid any additional assumptions that they cannot examine with the help of empirical data. Given that the most important step in mixed-methods research is triangulating the results (i.e., findings, inferences) from the qualitative and quantitative studies into a coherent conceptual framework that provides an effective answer to one’s research questions, one needs to properly develop good inferences in each strand of the study. In qualitative research, a good inference should “capture the meaning of the phenomenon under consideration for study participants” (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009, p. 295). A good qualitative inference is a credible inference; that is, “there is a correspondence between the way respondents actually perceive social constructs and the way researchers portray their overviews” (Mertens, 2005, p. 254). Venkatesh et al. (2013) summarize a variety of techniques for evaluating and enhancing the quality of inferences in qualitative research (i.e., design validity, analytical validity, and inferential validity). We discuss more details about these types of quantitative validities in Section 4. In quantitative research, a good inference has the following characteristics: 1) it establishes relations between variables and provides reasonable certainty that such relationships do not happen by chance; 2) its intensity matches the demonstrated magnitude of the relationship between variables, which the results of analyzing the data support; and 3) it is free of systematic bias in interpreting the results (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). One can use some validity criteria, such as statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct validity and external validity, to evaluate the quality of quantitative inferences (Venkatesh et al., 2013). We discuss more details about these types of quantitative validity in Section 4.\n",

            "Findings from mixed-methods research have three possible patterns: divergence, convergence, and complementarity (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). If the qualitative and quantitative methods applied in the study lead to divergent results (i.e., the qualitative and quantitative results contradict each other), two possible explanations exist: either the divergence is the result of methodological mistakes or the initial theoretical assumptions are incorrect (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). One should modify and revise theoretical assumptions as a consequence of divergent findings carefully. Researchers have to formulate ad-hoc hypotheses based on already-collected empirical data that may lead them to retain their initial theories and formulate “farreaching speculations that lack a sound empirical basis” (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003, p. 483). These newly developed hypotheses must increase the empirical content of the initial theoretical assumptions without diminishing their consistency, or these hypotheses must improve the consistency of the initial theory without losing empirical content. One also needs to empirically test the newly developed hypotheses using new data, and the newly developed hypotheses should be adaptable to other well-established theories about the phenomena under investigation (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). If the divergence results from methodological mistakes, researchers must engage in a re-examination process to assess whether the divergent findings are associated with the quality issues in one or more of the methods used or if they suggest a greater complexity inherent in the phenomenon under study (da Costa & Remedios, 2014). If the quantitative and qualitative methods lead to convergent results (i.e., the qualitative and quantitative methods lead to the same results), then the integration may provide good arguments for the quality of the inferences and strengthen the initial theoretical assumptions (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). Finally, if a mixedmethods approach leads to complementary results (i.e., the qualitative and quantitative results relate to different objects or phenomena but may complement each other), then the integration provides a more complete picture of the empirical domain under study (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003).\n",

Appendix B defines the different types of inference quality. In addition to design and explanatory quality, Onwuegbuzie and Johnson (2006) propose a typology including nine mixed-methods legitimation types: 1) sample integration, 2) inside-outside, 3) weakness minimization, 4) sequential, 5) conversion, 6) paradigmatic mixing, 7) commensurability, 8) multiple validities, and 9) political legitimation. Whereas Tashakkori and Teddlie’s (2010) quality framework assumes legitimation as an outcome that revolves around inference quality, Onwuegbuzie and Johnson’s typology views legitimation as a continuous process that one should evaluate at each stage of the mixed-research process. By bringing together Tashakkori and Teddlie’s (2010) concept of inference quality and Onwuegbuzie and Johnson’s nine aspects of legitimation, one can extensively assess the quality of a mixed-methods study by not only using the appropriate qualitative and quantitative quality standards but also applying the quality criteria that address the entire mixed-methods study. Sample integration legitimation applies to situations in which researchers aim to make statistical generalizations from a sample population to a larger population (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006). Insideoutside legitimation refers to “the extent to which the researcher accurately presents and appropriately utilizes the insider’s view and the observer’s views for purposes, such as description and explanation” (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006, p. 57). Weakness minimization legitimation refers to “the extent to which the weakness from one approach is compensated by the strengths from the other approach” (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006, p. 57). Sequential legitimation refers to “the extent to which one has minimized the potential problem wherein the meta-inferences could be affected by revising the sequence of the quantitative and qualitative phases” (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006, p. 57). To assess sequential legitimation, researchers can change the sequential design to a multiple wave design (i.e., one collects and analyzes the qualitative and quantitative data multiple times) (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006; Sandelowski, 2003). Conversion refers to the extent to which quantizing and qualitizing lead to interpretable data and high inference quality.

            "combine and blend their paradigmatic assumptions underlying the qualitative and quantitative approaches “into a usable package” (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006, p. 57). To meet commensurability legitimation, mixed-methods researchers need to be able to make Gestalt switches (i.e., to switch back and forth from a qualitative lens to a quantitative lens). This iterative process can create a viewpoint separate from and goes beyond what either a qualitative or quantitative viewpoint alone provides. Multiple validities legitimation refers to the extent to which one uses all relevant research strategies and the study meets multiple relevant validity criteria. Political legitimation, the last legitimation type, refers to “the extent to which consumers of mixed methods research value the meta-inferences stemming from both the qualitative and quantitative components of a study” (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006, p. 57). One of the strategies to achieve this legitimation is to use multiple perspectives and to generate practical theories or results that consumers will value because the results answer important questions and provide practical solutions (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006). Based on our discussion regarding the development and validation of inferences in mixed-methods research in steps 4 and 5, we summarize the general guidelines for developing high-quality meta-inferences in mixedmethods research in Table 3.\n",

Figures 1-4 present the decision tree depicting various design decisions that mixed-methods researchers have to make. The rectangles represent basic steps or process and design options in a research project, the diamonds indicate design decisions that researchers need to make, the arrows represent relationships between design decisions and/or processes, and the numbers inside the boxes represent the steps in conducting mixedmethods research as Table 2 describes. Our decision tree also shows that, although mixed-methods research always starts with one or more research questions, one can approach the other decisions in any order (i.e., one need not address them linearly or unidirectionally), and sometimes one can revise questions and/or purposes when needed (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004). Further, a decision at an earlier stage may or may not influence a decision at a later stage of research. For example, the decision associated with strands or phases of research influences the decision related to data collection and analysis; however, mixing strategies do not necessarily influence the decision associated with time orientation.\n",

Use the appropriate quantitative standards to assess the quality of quantitative inferences. 1. In mixed-methods research, the quality of inferences depends on the strength of inferences that emerge from the study’s qualitative and quantitative strands. 2. To develop meta-inferences in mixed-methods research, one can use inductive, deductive, both inductive and deductive, or abductive theoretical reasoning. 3. Meta-inferences must directly address the initial and intended purposes for using mixed methods. 4. Researchers’ study designs also influence their inferences. For example, in sequential mixed designs, researchers have to determine the purpose at the beginning of the study, or it might emerge from the inferences of the first strand. 5. One should assess the quality of meta-inferences made based on qualitative and quantitative inferences using design quality and explanatory quality (see Appendix B). One should also address other relevant legitimation types, such as sample integration legitimation, inside-outside legitimation, and conversion legitimation. 6. Possible patterns of mixed-methods research findings include: divergence, convergence, and complementarity. If the results diverge, one needs to identify the cause and reexamine the results. If the results converge, then the integration may provide a good argument for inference quality. If the results complement one other, one needs to use two or more methods to investigate the phenomenon under study.\n",

In this section, we illustrate one possible type of mixed-methods study in depth. We apply the guidelines we discuss previously to examining factors that influence technology adoption in households. For this illustration, we re-analyzed the qualitative data from Venkatesh and Brown (2001) and the quantitative data from Brown and Venkatesh (2005) using a mixedmethods research approach. Table 4 summarizes this illustrative study. We also include references to the model of decision choice (Figures 1 to 4) in Table 4. In Sections 4.1 to 4.8, we discuss the mixed-methods study in detail.

            "In reporting the appropriateness of a mixed-methods approach, researchers need to describe why a mixedmethods study is necessary. Researchers should start with and clearly state their research questions and then the purposes of mixed-methods research (Leech, 2012). Further, they need to state their study’s epistemological assumptions. The illustrative study addresses three research questions: one qualitative research question, one quantitative research question, and one mixed-methods research question. Although Venkatesh and Brown (2001) frame their study with objectives, we can translate them into the following question: “What are the factors that determine household PC adoption among adopters and non-adopters?” This research question was addressed in study 1. The qualitative component in this research question is broad (identifying the adoption factors) but specific enough to focus on the issue of technology adoption in households. Prior literature, at the time of the original research activities (late 1990s), did not provide adequate foundation for understanding IT adoption in households. For this reason, using qualitative data to answer this exploratory question was appropriate. Using data collected by Venkatesh and Brown, we employed a quantizing method to transform the qualitative data. We addressed the quantitative research question from Brown and Venkatesh’s (2005) paper 6 in the second study (study 2); that is: “Does the model of adoption of technology in households (MATH) explain household adoption and non-adoption of PCs?”. Brown and Venkatesh (2005) addressed this question using a survey methodology to operationalize the constructs identified in the qualitative phase of the study and empirically test MATH. We investigated the following mixed-methods question: “In what way do the results from the quantitative data collection (study 2) support or refute the results from the qualitative data collection (study 1)?”. We state our mixed-methods research question using a procedural focus—it explicitly directs the procedures for mixing the strands of a mixed-methods study and is tied to the specific design being used (Plano Clark & Badiee, 2010). This mixed-methods question focuses on the need to triangulate the findings from the study’s qualitative and quantitative phases. Because we can address the quantitative research question only after answering the qualitative research question, the questions depended on each other. Further, we can conduct triangulation only after addressing both the qualitative and quantitative research questions. The relationship of our research questions to the research process was predetermined—that is, we stated the questions at the beginning of the study based on our understanding of the literature.\n",

Thus, we do not discuss it here.\n",

            "Based on our research questions, the primary purpose of our illustrative study is triangulation or corroboration/confirmation, with an emergent element of complementarity. We used qualitative and quantitative techniques to validate the results through triangulation, and we used both qualitative and quantitative data to produce a more complete understanding of PC adoption and use through complementarity. The complementarity purpose seeks to enhance, illustrate, or clarify results from one method type using results from other methods (Caracelli & Greene, 1993). Because we used the results from study 2 to test and confirm the results from study 1, we can consider complementarity as a secondary purpose of our illustrative study. In the illustrative study, we adopted a single paradigm perspective. The overall mixed-methods study adopted the pragmatism paradigm (i.e., it combined positivist qualitative data collection and analysis with the positivist quantitative data collection and analysis). Although the nature of data in study 1 is qualitative, pragmatists believe that one can conduct a qualitative study using the positivist paradigm. Given the nature of the qualitative data analysis and subsequent statistical analysis in study 1, we consider study 1 to be a positivist qualitative study. Similar to study 1, study 2 adopted the positivist paradigm. Using two different methods supported our triangulation purpose, that is, to corroborate results across studies. The illustrative study focused on MATH and empirically derived and validated this model for adopters and non-adopters to identify the factors that influence technology adoption in households. Venkatesh and Brown (2001) proposed MATH using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1985, 1991) as the framework. According to the TPB, behavioral intention, which was the theory’s key dependent variable, is determined by attitude toward behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Using this framework, Venkatesh and Brown sought to understand and explain household PC adoption.\n",

When reporting the strategies, researchers need to delineate why they used a mixed-methods research design (Leech, 2012). Consistent with the research questions and paradigmatic assumptions discussed previously, we characterized study 1 as a predominantly exploratory study: although Venkatesh and Brown (2001) drew the initial constructs’ definitions from previous literature, they derived the final MATH constructs from the qualitative data. Study 2 was a confirmatory quantitative study: we analyzed quantitative data and operations with statistical analysis and inference. To achieve the purposes of mixed-methods research, a mixed-methods multistrand design was the appropriate design because study 2 needed to validate the results of study 1. Based on the strategy of mixing, this study adopted a partially mixed-methods design in which mixing occurs at the data analysis and inferential stages. Given that both the qualitative and quantitative components of the study contributed equally to address the research questions, our illustrative study followed an equivalent status design. Further, based on our research questions, the study’s overall mixed-methods research design followed a sequential design approach in which findings from the qualitative study informed the quantitative study (see Creswell et al., 2003; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007).

            "When writing a mixed-methods research report, much like all research reports, one should include enough information so that readers can fully understand how the researchers conducted the research (Gliner, Morgan, & Leech, 2009; Leech, 2012). Given that our mixed-methods study used a sequential mixedmethods design to develop and test MATH, our mixed-methods sampling-design strategy was a probability sampling with sequential design using parallel samples. The qualitative study was longitudinal: that is, it comprised data that Venkatesh and Brown (2001) collected from an initial interview of factors influencing purchase or use decisions and follow-up interviews six months after the initial interview to measure the dependent variables (i.e., purchase or use behaviors). Similarly, study 2 was longitudinal: that is, it comprised data Brown and Venkatesh (2005) collected from an initial survey to identify factors influencing purchase or use decisions and a follow-up survey six months after the initial survey to measure purchase behavior for those who did not own a PC at the time of the initial survey and use behavior for owners at the time of the initial survey. Thus, each study comprised two sub-samples: adopters and non-adopters. We used actual use behavior and purchase behavior as the dependent variables of adopters and non-adopters, respectively (see Brown & Venkatesh, 2005). Appendix C overviews the studies, sample sizes, and measurement timing. Brown and Venkatesh (2005) developed, pre-tested, and tested the scales for the MATH constructs. In writing a mixed-research report, researchers also need to describe and justify the analysis and explain how they combined and integrated their data sets. Consistent with our time-orientation, sampling-design, and datacollection strategies, we used a sequential qualitative-quantitative analysis design strategy with an emergent element of data-transformation technique (i.e., quantized) as our data-analysis strategy. In Sections 4.4 and 4.5, we discuss the qualitative and quantitative data analysis in study 1 and study 2, respectively.\n",

An important component of the method in Venkatesh and Brown’s (2001) study was that, once respondents who were primary decision makers in households identified a particular factor, the interviewers asked them to indicate the degree to which that factor was important in their decision to adopt or not to adopt a PC for household use. This technique provided not only the factors that the coders derived from coding the qualitative data but also the associated magnitude of importance (Babbie, 1990; Stone, 1978).\n",

            "Venkatesh and Brown (2001) employed two individuals to code the qualitative data. They provided the coders with construct definitions from existing models as Miles and Huberman (1994) suggest. Each coder preliminarily analyzed 30 randomly selected participants’ responses. Each participant could have provided multiple responses (reasons) for each decision. After this first round of coding, Venkatesh and Brown brought the coders together to discuss their coding. They resolved inter-coder discrepancies via discussion. The coders then coded the remaining data and held out any responses that did not fit easily into any of the constructs. Consistent with Weber (1990), they coded a given response against each of the constructs to determine the fit of the response with the conceptual definitions of the constructs. Although traditional content coding relies on an existing, tested coding scheme, no such coding scheme existed for household adoption of PCs when Venkatesh and Brown (2001) conducted the study. Thus, they derived a coding scheme from the TPB framework (Venkatesh & Brown, 2001). For example, if the respondents indicated that entertainment was a factor that drove their decision to buy a PC for household use, the coder coded this response as “applications for fun” and as a hedonic outcome under an attitudinal belief structure. Appendix D provides other coding examples. The coding process revealed 13 key factors of technology adoptions in households (i.e., MATH). These factors include attitudinal beliefs (i.e., applications for personal use, utility for children, utility for work-related use, applications for fun, and status gains), normative beliefs (i.e., friends and family influences, secondary sources’ influences, and workplace referents’ influences), and control beliefs (i.e., fear of technological advances, declining cost, cost, perceived ease of use, and requisite knowledge). Appendix E presents the construct definitions of MATH. Venkatesh and Brown (2001) identified the key factors of technology adoption in households through a coding process and, in this illustrative study, we converted the qualitative data into quantitative data (i.e., quantized them). Appendix F reports the descriptive statistics and correlations of the quantized data analysis. Given that we elicited open-ended responses and measured the magnitude of importance on a five-point scale, each coded response and the associated importance resulted in a single indicator for a specific construct. Therefore, in this case, the indicator variables and latent variables had a one-to-one correspondence. Although using single indicators does pose a potential problem, such use of coded qualitative data and the corresponding magnitudes (quantitative data) was consistent with approaches that Babbie (1990) and Miles and Huberman (1994) suggest. We assessed the quantitative validity of quantized data using several different techniques (see Appendix G).\n",

            "Before we analyzed the quantized data, we needed to establish validity in the qualitative data-collection procedures. We report three types of validity as Venkatesh et al. (2013) discuss: 1) design validity, 2) analytical validity, and 3) inferential validity. Design validity comprises descriptive validity, credibility, and transferability. We established descriptive validity (i.e., the accuracy of what researchers report) by providing information about the research setting (see earlier discussion about data-collection strategies) (Maxwell, 1992). To ensure study 1’s credibility and transparency (i.e., the extent to which qualitative research’s results are credible and believable), Venkatesh and Brown (2001) collected data from a large random sample of households via telephone interviews. To ensure transferability (i.e., the degree to which one can generalize qualitative research results to other contexts), Venkatesh and Brown used a longitudinal study with two waves of measurement: an initial interview (during a three-week window in March/April 1997) and a follow-up interview six months later. Venkatesh and Brown compared the characteristics of the sample to the population in general and found that the random sample of households included in this study highly represented the population of American households (see Venkatesh & Brown, 2001). Analytical validity comprises theoretical validity and plausibility, dependability, and consistency. During the data collection, Venkatesh and Brown (2001) established theoretical validity and plausibility (i.e., the extent to which a study’s theoretical explanations and the findings fit the data and are, therefore, credible and defensible) by using a well-designed protocol to collect the data (Orlikowski, 1993). They first pre-tested the interview protocol to solicit comments and suggestions about the instrument from respondents (Venkatesh & Brown, 2001). With the pre-test, they also identified wording issues that they needed to address. During the interview, the interviewers asked every question and in the prescribed order per the interview protocol, which helped maintain data reliability and credibility (Judd, Smith, & Kidder, 1991). To promote theoretical validity, they also used an existing theory (i.e., TPB) along with several established research bases in technology adoption, customer behavior, and psychology as guiding frameworks for the proposed\n",

Dependability in qualitative research emphasizes the need for the researcher to account for every change that occurs in the setting (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Venkatesh and Brown assessed dependability through inter-rater (or coder) reliability (IRR), which measures consistency in qualitative data-analysis procedures. The IRR was .89, which indicates a high degree of consistency. Venkatesh and Brown used triangulation to identify themes that several data sources shared and derived the coding schemes from an existing theoretical framework (Jick, 1979). To maintain consistency, Venkatesh and Brown trained 12 interviewers who had an average of 3.2 years’ experience in interviewing (including at least six months’ experience in telephone interviewing) on this particular interview protocol/script. Interviewers followed the same interview protocol/script for all the interviewees. Inferential validity comprises interpretive validity and confirmability. Little (if any) IS research has reported inferential validity. We believe that one needs to report this type of validity because qualitative researchers focus on not only validly describing the objects, events, and behaviors in the setting they study but also what these objects, events, and behaviors mean to the people engaged with them (Maxwell, 1992). In the original study, Venkatesh and Brown (2001) achieved interpretive validity (i.e., the degree to which researchers accurately understand participants’ views, thoughts, feelings, intentions, and experiences) by obtaining participant’s feedback during the interview. They also coded and reported the data as close as possible to participants’ accounts and interview transcripts and notes. They documented all procedures for checking and cross-checking the data throughout the study to ensure the qualitative study’s confirmability (i.e., the degree to which one can confirm or corroborate results with others) (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).\n",

Acceptable loadings (>.65) and low cross-loadings (<.30) in model tests for adopters and non-adopters further supported discriminant validity. Appendix I presents the ICRs, AVEs, descriptive statistics, and correlations. Although internal validity is a weakness of survey-based research, the longitudinal data collection here helped us provide better support for causality. The demographics comparison between the respondents and non-respondents at both periods (i.e., the initial survey and the follow-up survey conducted six months after the initial survey) showed no significant differences, which indicates that threats to internal validity (e.g., selection, history, maturation) did not influence the results (Brown & Venkatesh, 2005). We measured statistical conclusion validity by using an appropriate dataanalysis procedure and tool and by ensuring no statistical assumptions were violated. These validity criteria (i.e., internal validity, construct validity, discriminant validity, and statistical conclusion validity) also confirmed that the quantitative inference criteria were met (Venkatesh et al., 2013).\n",

            "\n",
            "In making the qualitative inferences, we followed the guidelines in Table 3. At the beginning of study 1, we inductively built a theoretical framework based on previous models (e.g., TPB). We used the resulting theoretical framework as the basis of study 2. We used inductive and (primarily) deductive theoretical reasoning to develop the meta-inferences. In our mixed-methods study, we assessed the credibility of inferences obtained from analyzing qualitative and quantitative data (i.e., triangulation with the emergence of complementarity). To do so, we used a triangulation technique to develop the meta-inferences. Triangulation techniques: 1) allow researchers to be more confident in their results, 2) can stimulate the creation of inventive methods and new ways of understanding a problem from multiple perspectives, 3) may help uncover various dimensions of a phenomenon, and (4) can lead to a synthesis or integration of theories (Jick, 1979). We developed the qualitative inferences first and the quantitative inferences second (see Table 5). In our illustrative study, the results showed a great deal of convergence but also revealed some inconsistent findings. Overall, we found that the same set of factors represented significant predictors of home PC adoption and use in both the qualitative and quantitative studies. Although the questionnaire used in the quantitative study was derived from the results of the interviews, we found two significant differences in findings between the studies. In the qualitative study, requisite knowledge was significant for current nonadopters but not significant in the quantitative study. In the qualitative study, status gains was significant for adopters but not significant in the quantitative study. One of the limitations of our study was that we did not re-examine the divergent findings using a new dataset (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). However, we offered a theoretical explanation to resolve the divergent findings. Because these divergent findings unlikely resulted from the authors’ mistake in collecting or analyzing the data (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5), we felt that re-examining theoretical assumptions was sufficient to address this issue. We explain these divergent findings next. First, analyzing the qualitative data for the current non-adopters group showed that the majority of respondents indicated requisite knowledge influenced their decision to adopt a PC. At the same time, they considered fear of technology change to be the main barrier. Based on the arguments they formulated, current non-adopters found requisite knowledge a dominant issue because they found learning a new technology to be difficult. Thus, requisite knowledge likely had no direct effect (or the effect was small) on purchase behavior. However, other variables could mediate this relationship. For example, in their study, Kim and Kankanhalli (2009) found that requisite knowledge (i.e., self-efficacy) had no direct effect on user resistance. Rather, switching cost mediated the effect of self-efficacy on user resistance. With respect to our results, we need further investigation to test whether requisite knowledge has an indirect effect on purchase behavior through mediating variables. For instance, individuals’ belief that they have the knowledge necessary to use a PC may influence their perception of the utility they would achieve when using the PC, which, in turn, would influence their purchase behavior. This potential mediating relationship could, therefore, explain the non-significant direct effect of requisite knowledge that we found in study 2. Second, we found status gains to be significant among current adopters in the qualitative study but not significant in the quantitative study. Contrary to the finding from the quantitative study, prior research has reported that status gains was an important determinant of adoption behaviors (e.g., Fisher & Price, 1992; Kim & Han, 2009). Moreover, the innovation literature has indicated that social outcomes, such as status gains, are important in the early stage of technology adoption (Venkatesh & Brown, 2001). Social rewards do not likely influence later adopters because the status value of adopting diminishes as more people adopt (Brown & Venkatesh, 2003). Overall, our meta-inferences are consistent with MATH’s theoretical concepts. Integrating the qualitative and quantitative research strands has successfully added value beyond the individual studies. Given that study 1 and 2 data are from different sets of participants and different data-collection procedures, the findings’ similarity indicates we used strong theoretical models as our research foundation. The results’ richness and robustness gives us confidence about the factors that predict household PC adoption and use. The mixed-methods design helped us identify and understand the factors that influence household PC adoption and use. The qualitative study helped us identify a set of factors and their importance, and the quantitative study helped us empirically examine the theoretical model (developed from the qualitative study) to identify what factors drive household PC adoption and use and how these factors help explain the behavior differences between adopters and non-adopters. Taken together, these studies explain the factors that drive household PC adoption and use. Table 5 summarizes our meta-inferences.\n",

Quality of Meta-inferences Criteria Indicators • The study started with the qualitative phase (study 1) to address the first research question (i.e., what are the factors that determine household PC adoption among adopters and nonadopters?) followed by the quantitative phase (study 2) to address the second research question (i.e., does MATH explain household adoption and non-adoption of PCs?). We addressed the first question from Venkatesh and Brown (2001) using a qualitative method because, at the time when they conducted the study, prior literature did not provide adequate foundation for understanding IT adoption in households. We addressed the second research question from Brown and Venkatesh (2005) using a survey methodology to operationalize the Design suitability constructs identified in the qualitative phase of the study (study 1) and empirically test the model of adoption of technology in households. • We answered the mixed-methods research question (i.e., in what way do the results from the quantitative data collection (study 2) support or refute the results from the qualitative data collection (study 1)?) by triangulating the findings from the qualitative and quantitative studies. • Based on the research questions and specified purposes of the project, we carefully selected the mixed-methods designs (see Table 4). • We integrated various design components (e.g., sampling, data collection and analysis procedures) and applied the selected criteria to address the research questions. • We used two major sources of data: 1) open- and closed-ended qualitative interviews (Venkatesh & Brown, 2001) and 2) standardized questionnaire surveys to measure the various constructs described in MATH (Brown & Venkatesh, 2005). Design adequacy • Both the qualitative and quantitative study were longitudinal. In collecting the qualitative data, the interviewers followed the same protocol to maintain consistency. A comparison between the sample characteristics and the population characteristics in general showed that the sample represented the population. In collecting the quantitative data, the measurement items were carefully developed, pre-tested, and tested based on the results of study 1. • We adopted a sequential mixed-methods data-analysis approach to analyze the data. • We converted qualitative data into quantitative data. We statistically analyzed quantized data to test the hypothesized relationships. • We analyzed quantitative data using PLS-SEM. We chose PLS because it is robust and has few identifiability issues (Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2011). • Percentage of explained variance in the structural model of both the qualitative and quantitative studies was consistent, which suggests the study designs were appropriate to create the expected effect. • Meta-inferences resulted from triangulating the qualitative and quantitative findings. For example, the qualitative inference is “The effect of applications for personal use was significant for both current adopters and non-adopters” and the quantitative inference is “Utility for children and utility for work-related use were positively associated with the use behavior of current owners. However, only utility for work-related use was significant for non-adopters.”. We integrate these inferences to develop a meta-inference (i.e., utilitarian outcomes (i.e., personal use and work-related) were positively associated with use behavior (for current adopters) and purchase (for non-adopters)) (see Table 5 for details). • We theoretically explain the inconsistent findings across studies. For example, the qualitative study revealed that status gains was significant for owners but not for current non-owners, whereas the quantitative study showed status gains was not significant for both groups. We explain this consistency by reviewing the innovation literature (see Table 5 for details). • Inferences were consistent with the initial hypotheses of MATH. • The model is generalizable to the household population in the US but not necessarily to other countries, unless individuals adopted the PC in a similar way in these countries. • The outcomes and inferences might be applicable to study the adoption of other related technologies.\n",

            "In our illustrative study, although we addressed most of the legitimation issues, we did not address sequential legitimation, paradigmatic mixing, and commensurability legitimation. One method to assess sequential legitimation is to change the sequence of the research study. Because we re-analyzed alreadycollected data for this illustration, we could not assess sequential legitimation in this work. However, because most of our qualitative and quantitative inferences were consistent, we believe that the threat to sequential legitimation is not a major issue in our study. We did not address paradigmatic mixing in our illustration because we employed a pragmatism paradigm (i.e., both studies used a positivist approach). However, we successfully integrated the qualitative and quantitative inferences to develop meta-inferences. We also discussed the inference quality of the qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Finally, one can address commensurability legitimation if one can negotiate cognitively the importance of Gestalt switches— switching back and forth from a qualitative lens to a quantitative lens (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006). Onwuegbuzie and Johnson (2006) suggest that one can do so through cognitive and empathy training, and, if researchers have a limited ability to do this gestalt switch, then the researchers can ignore commensurability legitimation. Conducting mixed-methods research involves inherent challenges that make it more difficult than conducting a monomethod study. We review some of the challenges we encountered in the illustrative study (see Appendix B). First, researchers must understand and explain the rationale for using a mixed-methods research approach in their study (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Although we used two, independent papers for our illustrative study, they were from the same research program in which the authors employed a mixed-methods approach for collecting and analyzing the data. The initial challenge we encountered in this illustrative study was finding the rationale for combining the qualitative and quantitative data in the face of seemingly incompatible paradigms. Selecting an appropriate paradigm is a necessary step to justify one’s using a mixedmethods approach. To deal with this issue, we employed a pragmatism paradigm approach by combining the positivist qualitative data collection and analysis with the positivist quantitative data collection and analysis. Understanding the philosophical assumptions underlying each paradigm can also be a challenge for researchers because it requires knowledge and methodological expertise in multiple areas. The second challenge is associated with selecting the most suitable design to address the research questions. The process of selecting the best mixed-methods research design involves several steps as the decision tree presents (see Figure 1). To select the most appropriate design, researchers need to understand the characteristics and goals of each design choice. For example, in our illustrative study, we discussed the rationale for selecting a multistrand design that led to our selecting a sequential (explanatory) design and an equivalent status design. The design options discussed in this paper could be overwhelming, especially for those who are new to the field. Conducting mixed-methods research also requires more time and resources (e.g., funding, staffing). Without enough time and resources in one’s research team, a mixedmethods research project can be challenging.\n",

            "The issue of nomenclature and basic definitions used in mixed-methods research is another challenge in conducting a mixed-methods study (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). For example, although quantitative research studies routinely use the term “validity”, many qualitative researchers object to using this term (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006). In contrast, some qualitative researchers (e.g., Maxwell, 1992) do not refute using the term “validity” in qualitative research. Similarly, in the context of mixed-methods research, some scholars have used different terms to refer to the same concepts. For example, Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003) propose the term inference quality to refer to validity in the context of mixed-methods research (Venkatesh et al., 2013), whereas Onwuegbuzie and Johnson (2006) recommend that validity in mixed-methods research be termed legitimation. We believe that mixed-methods researchers should adopt a common nomenclature for validation to differentiate mixed-methods validation from qualitative and quantitative validation (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003; Venkatesh et al., 2013). We should diminish the differences in terminology to maintain consistency across mixed-methods studies. In our illustrative study, some of the results from the qualitative study were inconsistent with the qualitative study. As a result, we had to examine our findings more closely and review the existing literature more carefully to create a more advanced theoretical explanation (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Identifying the major source of inconsistency can be challenging in mixed-methods research because it requires researchers to reexamine the data, reassess the inference quality, go back to the literature, and even collect a new dataset (Erzerber & Kelle, 2003). Despite the challenge of identifying the source of inconsistency, divergent inferences in a mixed-methods study might lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon under study (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).\n",

Researchers can be flexible in selecting their designs based on the objectives of their study. For example, one can use a multiple paradigmatic stance (e.g., researchers might use interpretivism in their qualitative study and positivism in their quantitative study) to address the research questions proposed in our illustrative study. Researchers can also adopt either qualitative dominant or quantitative dominant designs depending on the purpose of their study. For example, if one primarily focuses on identifying factors that determine PC adoption in households, then one should select the qualitative dominant design with the interpretivism paradigm and sequential-exploratory design.\n",

            "Researchers can flexibly integrate the 14 properties discussed to help them select the most suitable mixedmethods designs for their studies. We suggest that, when planning a mixed-methods study, researchers should consider these properties and select those most relevant to the objectives of their study. Among these 14 properties, research questions, purposes of mixed-methods research, and paradigmatic assumptions are absolutely fundamental during the study’s conceptualization stage. For example, in our illustrative study, we used the research questions and purposes of mixed-methods research as our basic foundation for selecting the mixed-methods design based on the assumptions underlying pragmatism. At the methodological stage, the components of time orientation, data collection strategies, and data analysis strategies are critical and should not be overlooked in mixed-methods research because they determine the quality of inferences. Other properties, such as priority of methodological approach, can be less salient depending on the research questions. For example, if it is unclear whether the qualitative or quantitative data will ultimately be the most important in the results and inferences, then priority of approach is not a critical element of design dimensions (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010). One should also assess the inference quality carefully because inferences are the most important aspects or outcomes of mixed-methods research (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010).\n",

            "This research makes several key contributions to the literature on mixed methods. First, we extend the guidelines of Venkatesh et al. (2013) for mixed-methods research by integrating 14 properties of mixed methods into the guidelines. Our guidelines complement the other existing mixed-methods research guidelines (e.g., Maxwell & Loomis, 2003; Nastasi et al., 2010; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998, 2003b). Critically, our guidelines integrate various dimensions of mixed-methods research to accommodate different types of mixed-methods designs. Although we position the guidelines in an IS context, due to the dearth of guidance on how to better execute mixed-methods research, they are also broadly applicable beyond IS. Second, we show how one can use mixed-methods research to extract significant findings that the limitations inherent in a single method alone can compromise. Through this study, we provide researchers with the information necessary to select the best mixed-methods designs for their research project based on 14 general properties of the studies that scholars have well established in mixed-methods research. We also offer a decision tree to map the flow and relationship among the design strategies. Third, we illustrate one possible type of mixed-methods research in depth by characterizing the study from multiple dimensions of mixed-methods research. Our illustration shows that researchers can select the designs of mixed-methods research that best fit with their research questions and purposes. This illustration provides an opportunity to open up the research process from which the research community may learn about the best practices and the challenges in conducting mixed-methods research. Fourth, we contribute to the development of mixed-methods research, particularly in the IS field. We argue that the use of mixed methods, if done well, may drive the development of IS research. Although using mixed-methods research in social science is in its adolescence (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003), its use in IS is relatively new. We suggest that IS researchers familiarize themselves with the theoretical paradigms and different properties of mixed-methods research. Although research methods and theoretical paradigms that underlie these methods should follow the research questions, IS researchers should be able to integrate those different paradigms and not rely solely on a single paradigm (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998; Venkatesh et al., 2013). We also advise IS researchers to be flexible in making their research design decisions depending on the purposes of their mixed-methods research study.\n",

Thus, we need future research to illustrate how to conduct different types of mixed-methods studies based on different properties of mixed-methods research discussed in this paper. For instance, one could conduct mixed-methods research to answer a research question with expansion and developmental purposes to increase the validity of constructs and inquiry results by selecting the most appropriate methods and maximizing the method strengths (Greene et al., 1989). Based on their research question(s) and well-defined purposes, researchers then can select the most appropriate paradigmatic assumptions and determine their mixed-methods design strategies.\n",

            "In this paper, we extend Venkatesh et al.’s (2013) guidelines for mixed-methods research by elaborating various properties of such studies. The integrative framework that we presented accommodates different types of mixed-methods research. We deliberately tried to be comprehensive in selecting and reviewing the mixed-methods properties to offer researchers the opportunity to properly use a mixed-methods approach in their study. We illustrate one possible type of mixed-methods research in depth—one of the first illustrations that applies various properties of mixed-methods research by incorporating qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis in a sequential manner and that explains the decisions made at various stages of the research endeavor. In this illustration, we also present how we developed and validated meta-inferences in a broader research program. Note that the specific guidelines we propose and illustrate reflect a certain set of preferences and are dominated by our paradigmatic assumptions in-use. We do not seek to constrain all mixed-methods researchers to follow the same research designs as our example illustrates. Instead, we provide general guidelines that enable authors to critically think about their designs prior to the study and offer justification of their approaches after the study. Thus, authors and reviewers need to be flexible in adapting the guidelines based on the objectives of their study and the ontological and epistemological assumptions underlying the different components of their mixed-methods studies. We hope this work motivates researchers to adopt mixed methods in their research projects to gain richer insights into phenomena they investigate.\n",

There are three types of sequential mixed-methods designs: (a) Sequential explanatory (i.e., characterized by one’s collecting and analyzing quantitative data and, subsequently, collecting and analyzing qualitative data; a theoretical perspective may or may not be present); (b) Sequential exploratory (i.e., characterized by one’s initially collecting and analyzing qualitative data and, subsequently, collecting and analyzing quantitative data; a theoretical perspective may or may not be present); (c) Sequential transformative (i.e., one can user either method first; one must prioritize either the quantitative or the qualitative phase; a theoretical perspective is present to guide the study). There are three types of concurrent mixed-methods designs: (a) Concurrent triangulation (i.e., one uses two different methods are to confirm, cross-validate, or corroborate findings in a single study; generally no predominant method to guide the project; a theoretical perspective may or may not be present); (b) Concurrent nested (i.e., one collects data in one phase during which one collects quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously; it has a predominant method to guide the project; a theoretical perspective may or may not be present); (c) Concurrent transformative (i.e., one uses a specific theoretical perspective that may take on the design features of either a triangulation or nested design).

Review of Selected Theoretical Literature in Mixed-methods Research Property of mixedmethods approach Reference(s) Dimensions Description In this mixed-methods design, researchers collect quantitative data after collecting qualitative data to test and explain relationships found based on analyzing qualitative data. This design involves a concurrent design using “exactly the same sample members participate in both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study” (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007, p. 292). This design involves a concurrent design in which “the samples for the qualitative and quantitative components of the research are different but are drawn from the same population of interest” (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007, p. 292). This design involves a concurrent design in which “the sample members selected for one phase of the study represent a subset of those participants chosen for the other facet of the investigation” (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007, p. 292). This design involves a concurrent design using “two or more sets of samples that are extracted from different levels of the study” (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007, p. 292).

The basic mixed-methods sampling strategies include purposive sampling and probability sampling. Purposive sampling refers to “selecting units (e.g., individuals, groups of individuals, institutions) based on specific purposes associated with answering a research study’s questions”. Probability sampling involves “selecting a relatively large number of units from a population, or from specific subgroups (strata) of a population, in a random manner where the probability of inclusion for every member of the population is determinable” (Teddlie & Yu, 2007, p. 77).\n",

            "After we collected the quantitative data, we assessed the validity of the quantized data from study 1 (analyzed in the first phase of the study) using different techniques. First, we performed a normality test to ensure that the model specification was appropriate for our data. The test of normality revealed that the residuals were normally distributed and the skewness and kurtosis coefficients were fairly similar across two datasets. Second, we performed mean differences tests to examine whether the sample means differed across two data collections (see Table G1). Given that we collected the two datasets at different periods using two different methods and scales, we expected nominal significant differences across two datasets. As expected, the results showed some statistically significant differences (e.g., the mean of status gains among adopters was higher in study 2 than in study 1). Because we analyzed the data independently of one another, these mean differences were unlikely a major problem in our study.\n",

            "Further, we performed a standardized mean difference (SMD) or Cohen’s d test to estimate the method effect employed in each phase of the study (see Table G2). The SMD assumes that the differences in standard deviations among studies reflect differences in measurement scales and not real differences in variability among study populations (Higgins & Green, 2011). An SMD of zero indicates that the two samples have equivalent effects and the SMD increases as the difference between two samples increases. Cohen (1988) offers the following guidelines for interpreting the magnitude of the SMD in the social sciences: small, SMD = 0.2; medium, SMD = 0.5; and large, SMD = 0.8. The results revealed that most of the SMD scores in the non-adopters condition were significant, which indicates the two samples have nonequivalent effects. The significance of SMD coefficients confirmed the need to adopt a mixed-methods research approach in this study to minimize the weaknesses of either quantitative or qualitative methods and uncover the contradictory findings (if any) through comparing the qualitative data- and quantitative data-analysis results.\n",

            "Viswanath Venkatesh is a Distinguished Professor and George and Boyce Billingsley Chair in Information Systems at the Walton College of Business, University of Arkansas. His research focuses on understanding the diffusion of technologies in organizations and society. For over two decades, he has worked with several companies and government agencies, and has rigorously studied real-world phenomena. The sponsorship of his research has been about US$10M. His work has appeared in leading journals in human-computer interaction, information systems, organizational behavior, psychology, marketing, medical informatics, and operations management journals. He is one of only two scholars to have published 20 or more papers in MIS Quarterly (MISQ). From 2006-2015, he was the most productive in terms of publications in the premier journals in information systems (i.e., Information Systems Research (ISR) and MISQ). He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scholars in business and economics, with about 55,000 citations and about 14,000 citations per Google Scholar and Web of Science, respectively. In 2014, he was recognized by Thomson Reuters as one of only 95 high-impact scholars in business and economics (highlycited.com) based on publications from 2000 to 2012. In 2008, his MISQ (2003) paper was identified as a current classic by Science Watch (a Thompson Reuters’ service), and, since 2009, it has been the most influential paper in one of the four Research Front Maps in business and economics. Since 2012, he serves as a Senior Editor (SE) at MISQ. From 2008 to 2011, he served as an SE at ISR. MISQ named him “Reviewer of the Year” in 1999. Susan A. Brown is the McClelland Professor of Management Information Systems in the Eller College of the University of Arizona. Prior to joining the University of Arizona, Dr. Brown was an assistant professor at Indiana University. She completed her PhD at the University of Minnesota and an MBA at Syracuse University. Her research interests include technology implementation, individual adoption, computermediated communication, technology-mediated learning, and related topics. She has received funding for her research from the National Science Foundation, and other public and private organizations. Her work has appeared in journals including MIS Quarterly, Information Systems Research, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, Journal of Management Information Systems, and others.

            "The confluence of widely available malleable technology and the “bring your own device” (BYOD) trend creates a new dynamic for information technology innovation in the workplace. Nontechnical users are empowered to adapt pliable technology in the course of normal usage episodes. We develop a theoretical perspective of adaptation behaviors by extending the adaptive structuration theory (AST) to the level of individuals, and present a topology of adaptation behaviors to capture the rich landscape of this emerging phenomenon. Based on this new theoretical perspective, we propose a research model and perform a survey study targeting young professionals to empirically investigate adaptation of malleable IT by users. Our findings reveal the compounding effects of four distinct adaptation behaviors including the insight that task adaptation mediates the effect of technology adaptation on individual performance. This study contributes by providing a theoretical framework for examining adaptation behaviors, extending AST to the level of individuals, and addressing specific criticisms of AST in the information systems literature.

In an effort to improve the process, Jane started using her phone to call in particularly valuable items to speed the pedigree and appraisal process.

Her next step was a shift to a white ruler, manipulating the exposure settings when capturing images and performing post-processing color correction to deliver images with consistent quality. After cataloging all items in her paper ledger, Jane would then photograph the full ledger and e-mail that to the office, effectively removing travel delays from the process. Jane has also posted a few items on existing auction web sites to expand their estate auction marketplace from in-person to online, a move that could transform their business from local to international. While Jane was pleased with the communication efficiencies gained with each of these improvements, her coworker Jill went a different direction. Jill downloaded a readily available spreadsheet app to her phone, established a data entry form and records her inventory electronically. These spreadsheets are forwarded to the office through e-mail and eliminate manual reentry steps to further streamline the overall process. Jill has now installed a photo management app with back end cloud-based storage on her smartphone and is devising a mashup to seamlessly link image libraries with her inventory spreadsheets. By introducing these technical capabilities, Jill has transformed her phone from an information dissemination device to a repository of record for company data and a focal point for analysis and collaboration. She has also unintentionally created new risks related to protecting the integrity, availability, and security of company data. This fictional example where employees creatively adapt IT, sometimes altering the technology artifact’s capabilities, to reinterpret workplace tasks is becoming a commonplace reality in businesses today. The confluence of two trends makes the phenomenon of user-driven adaptation increasingly pervasive and worthy of more attention. One driver is the emergence of malleable IT. Contemporary information technologies, such as widely available mobile computing devices (DesAutels 2011), invite lay users, with no special technical skills, to manipulate and modify IT capabilities as part of the usage regimen (Hartmann et al. 2008). This new realm of malleable IT is described by terms such as editable, fluid, interactive, open, reprogrammable, pliable, and transfigurable (Kallinikos et al. 2013). These objects allow ordinary users to innovate in a range of means, from novel combinations of existing services (Sun 2012) to outright revision, reinvention, and creation of new IT features and capabilities (Leonardi 2011). The traditional role of user participation shifts from that of customer, whose involvement in the development process is to deliver application domain knowledge during design and use (Henfridsson and Lindgren 2010), to a more active role performing direct adaptation (DesAutels 2011; von Hippel 2005).\n",

            "A second trend is the speed with which the “bring your own device” (BYOD) phenomenon is invading businesses (King 2014). Enabled by an ecosystem of technology providers engaged in an escalating competition to empower users, trends indicate most employees will soon be conducting work on smart devices (Wirthman 2013). As employees acting individually begin adapting personal devices to organization tasks in unexpected and nonstandard ways, securing company data and protecting private information becomes a growing challenge (Tokuyoshi 2013). In the introductory example Jane exposed information to unauthorized snooping when she sent inventory information through the public e-mail. In different situations where the data includes sensitive information such as bank account numbers, intellectual property, or proprietary secrets, deviations from carefully scrutinized processes introduce new risks. As employees adapt contemporary technologies in unexpected ways and for unforeseen purposes, established IT organizations are faced with a highly dynamic landscape with much less central control. Theorizing the manipulations that individual users apply to malleable IT requires both a rich conceptualization of the IT artifact as a dynamic and evolving entity (Orlikowski and Iacono 2001) and the intimate involvement users have with the technology during usage episodes (Burton-Jones and Straub 2006). Adaptive structuration theory (AST) has been applied to study the evolution-in-use of advanced IT by groups and teams (DeSanctis et al. 2008). This study extends the framework of AST to the level of individuals and thereby explains adaptation of malleable IT by nontechnical users. In so doing, this study responds to calls for IS research to collectively examine technology, user, and task in context (Hong et al. 2014) while also taking on the “sparsely” studied realm of pliable information systems (Kallinikos et al. 2013). This study has three specific objectives to better understand the expanding phenomenon of user interaction with malleable IT. First, we map AST into the domain of individuals. Second, after mapping the operative constructs, we develop a theory-guided topology capturing the breadth of adaptation behaviors at the level of individuals. This extension of AST exposes and describes structuration episodes as the individual level parallel to social interactions. Finally, we propose and empirically test a research model grounded in AST for Individuals (ASTI) to demonstrate how these adaptation behaviors are compounded within usage episodes of individual users to influence performance. This paper is organized as follows: The next section provides an overview of structuration and AST leading to a constructby-construct mapping to the level of individuals to establish a new theory describing user adaptation of technology.

Orlikowski (1992) describes a “duality of technology” that mirrors Giddens’s “duality of structure. Technologies are not simply physically constructed by their designer and implementers, but are also socially constructed by the interpretive action of users who give meaning to the technology every time they appropriate it. Technologies exert their power of domination when users conform to usage cues delivered with the IT. However, empowered users create new interpretations that redefine both task and technology structures (Orlikowski 2000).\n",

Structures are the norms, templates, and work process biases that create expectations for how social interactions should take place. Structuration is the process through which actors select, adapt, apply, manipulate and alter available structures. Structures exist because they were enacted by prior action and serve as a guide to shape current interactions, which in turn reinforce, recreate, and redefine structures for subsequent interactions. The “duality of structure” is a dialectic resolved by recognizing that structures guide action while simultaneously being defined by that action. Consequently, each interaction episode is both a singular event with meaning and a building block for an ongoing process (Orlikowski 1992).\n",

            "Developing AST for Individuals (ASTI)\n",
            "While AST is widely employed to study adaptation and change at the level of groups and organizations, scholars have been reluctant to apply it at the level of individuals (Jones and Karsten 2008). This may be rooted in AST’s dependence on social mechanisms that are so evident among groups and organizations. This gap is easily bridged by an appreciation that users treat technologies as complex social actors in their own right (Kling and Scacchi 1982), with social meaning established by the context of use (Barley 1986). User connection with IT goes beyond routine appropriation, to a relationship where individuals remember past interactions in the form of memories, attributions and feelings, and thereby establish expectations for the future (Al-Natour and Benbasat 2009). Individuals internalize a broad range of structural influence from technologies including gender and ethnic stereotypes, politeness and reciprocity, and even personality (Nass and Moon 2000). With the emergence of malleable IT, this relationship becomes interactive, with give and take by both parties. Furthermore, the underlying theory of structuration is robust to individual actions as “the process of structuration operates at multiple levels of analysis: individual, group and social system” (Orlikowski and Robey 1991, p. 148). Input: Structures for Adaptation AST’s sources of structure have clear parallels from the level of groups involved in social interaction to the level of individuals involved in adaptation as depicted in Figure 2. AST employs an ensemble view of technology with structural features and spirit established by a designer and reified during appropriation (Orlikowski 1992). At the level of individuals, the technology construct encompasses technical objects (the artifact and its component parts—the presence perceived by\n",

ITfacilitated social interactions are organized by AST as Input ÷ Process ÷ Output sequences (see Figure 1). AST identifies the inputs of technology, task, and organizational environment to be the objects that hold and convey social structure into group discourse. In addition, important contingency factors are provided by a group’s existing internal system (its style, memory models, knowledge, and conventions). Structuration is a process that brings the sources of structure into social interactions where they are applied and reproduced. By engaging the social structures of IT, technology gains meaning, creates process outcomes,and generates new structural resources that may be transferred across boundaries of time and space to impose their biases on subsequent episodes (Gopal et al. 1993).

In the case of malleable IT, these dimensions of a technology are editable by users who interactively rearrange, add, delete, or even modify individual elements (Kallinikos et al. 2013). These technology characteristics, the artifact and its component parts identified as the first block in the input column of Figure 2, provide the technology raw materials available to a user entering an episode of use. Task related structures in AST include both the process structures and environment structures present when interaction takes place. At the level of individuals, these map to a bundling of individual work processes and environmental constraints on those tasks, as indicated in the second block in Figure 2’s input column. The result is a collective conceptualization that includes situation-specific requirements for performing a task. AST’s final input block is the group’s internal system encompassing assets of participants. This includes transactive memories, group efficacy, style of leadership, and conventions for group behavior and team goals, each with parallels for an individual. Individual knowledge, experience and learning is similar to group memories. Individual personality imposes influence similar to a group’s style of leadership. Individual affective states with accumulated skills and abilities operate similar to emergent group efficacy. While we don’t contend that the parallel constructs function in exactly the same way, they each provide structural influence on behaviors that complete the metaphor linking AST and ASTI. For individuals, this influence begins with personality traits that predispose some individuals to engage in innovation (Agarwal and Prasad 1998). Beyond the static influence of personality, the recursive nature of structuration becomes apparent for individuals through the influence of experience (Venkatesh et al. 2003) and emotional reactions (Compeau et al. 1999) that build and evolve over a series of usage episodes. These sructures for adaptation provide technology, task, and individual characteristics that influence adaptation during a usage episode. Process: Adaptation Within Structuration Episodes Task and technology do not spontaneously adapt of their own accord, which draws our interest to the role of the human actor as the instigator. Each structure for adaptation has some degree of malleability. Some work tasks may be largely fixed by constraints such as statutory regulation and laws of nature.\n",

            "Individuals may have varying levels of autonomy, organizational license, technical skill, or motivation to color outside the lines. Similarly, some technologies may be more or less malleable due to security precautions taken by the developer, economic practicality, or limitations in scientific advancement. When individual users engage technologies to perform a task, a decision is made to use the technology as currently understood for the conventional work task, or to supplement this behavior by attempting adaptations. The duality of structure exposes the input structures of technology and task to be both the recipients of adaptation behaviors and the antecedents to that behavior. We apply the label structuration episodes to usage events that involve adaptation. This recognizes the structural implication of usage episodes where individuals put technology into action and where structures may be reified or redefined. Researchers often aggregate technology adaptation with procedures, tasks, techniques, assumptions, knowledge, and relationships into an overall adaptation and innovation concept (Ahuja and Thatcher 2005; Barki et al. 2007; Sun 2012). In this study, we separate these composites to provide a more granular description of user behaviors. As seen in the “Process” block of Figure 2, there is a distinction between adaptation of technology and adaptation of tasks. Technology moves by individuals parallel the appropriation actions of groups in AST. Task adaptation parallels AST’s decision process at the group level. Classic software engineering practices go to great lengths to distinguish task requirements characterizing what must be done—the task—from technology specifications that describe how to implement a solution (Vick 1984). The distinction between task and technology is also relevant during post adoption adaptation. Task is defined as the actions performed while turning inputs into outputs, whereas technologies are the tools used in carrying out these tasks (Goodhue and Thompson 1995). The distinction is contextually and cognitively important for individual users. Users are experts in the task domain, possessing a deep understanding of the processes and procedures that generate their target productive outcome. By contrast, users are rarely experts in the underlying technology with which their tools are constructed (Tiwana 2009). While post-adoption adaptation encompasses change to technology and task (Beaudry and Pinsonneault 2005), all users are not equally equipped to address both. From the introduction example, Jill may possess individual characteristics that make her more likely to attempt a mashup than Jane. The difference between task adaptation and technology adaptation is apparent in the direction of transference associated with structures. An IT’s user interface projects the designer’s\n",

            "vision2 into a usage episode (Markus and Silver 2008). In the process of appropriating a new technology, users interact with these embedded biases and respond by adapting processes and task structures. Technology adaptation imposes different structures back into the technology, embedding new biases and assumptions of how the changed technology should operate. The direction of transference is reversed, with the user inscribing capabilities and symbolism into the technology artifact and thereby altering the values of a technology. Two additional insights are associated with this model. First, technology adaptation precedes task adaptation. The precedence of adaptation behaviors is guided by the notion that technologies do not generate outcomes until they are applied to a task. Technology adaptations have no consequences in isolation; rather, they depend upon task adaptations that bring functional affordances into contact with a work process. In addition, introducing any technology to an existing task triggers adjustments including task changes to accommodate the new technology (Beaudry and Pinsonneault 2005). As such, task adaptation is theorized to mediate the effect of technology adaptation. Elements of this theoretical model are detailed in the next section involving hypotheses development where they can be more cogently presented. Second, an altered view of spirit is important to complete the mapping of AST from the level of groups to the level of individuals. The spirit of a technology introduced as the designer’s intent must be reconceptualized in this era of malleable technology where the user participates in the (re)design of technology structures. From the perspective of ASTI, the spirit of a technology exists as a user’s understanding of that technology’s capabilities and affordances. This spirit may have been manipulated and adjusted many times during structuration episodes taking place after the original developer’s work is complete. Adaptations may be subtle, adjusting within the realm of the current spirit, or may be dramatic with transformational consequences. This revised concept of spirit is no longer determined solely by the intent of the developer, but rather is tied to how the user understands the technology as it is available in a given usage episode.\n",
            "\n",
            "Output: Outcomes and Emergent Structures As with input sources of structure, AST outputs have parallels at the level of individuals. The forthright output of executing a work task has first order performance value similar to AST’s group level decision outcomes. Each structuration episode culminates in a task outcome that has benefit for the setting in which a task takes place. This outcome may vary from one usage episode to another as individuals adapt the technology and/or task and thereby alter the performance potential. As illustrated in the introduction example, faster delivery of information to the office may allow the organization to turn these items into sales and revenue sooner. AST also recognizes that emergent and new structures are supplemental outputs. Social interactions using group IT create reports and information that have structural influence in their own right. These structures may be temporary, affecting only the current social interaction, or they may be reified over the course of multiple interactions and thereby create new, persistent social structures. The corresponding outputs at the level of individuals are both transient and persistent structures for adaptation. As technology features and capabilities of an IT artifact are modified by users, new possibilities are created that make the artifact qualitatively different with new value over and above that which previously existed (Tyre and Orlikowski 1994). In addition, new, redefined, and transformed task processes improvised during structuration episodes may similarly be tried and discarded or remembered and routinized. From the introduction example, we see Jane positioning a small ruler into her photographs, then later this is revised to a white ruler providing a reliable baseline for color correction. Finally, aspects of an individual, such as their emotional attitudes toward structures and their experience with those structures may change over time, even as these characteristics influence each usage episode. Point-in-time adaptations of input structures are depicted as transient structures in Figure 2. These changes may be fleeting with meaning and influence during a single episode, even if they are forgotten soon after. Neglect is expected for adaptations with unfavorable outcomes. Adaptations that create value are more likely to be retained and persist across usage events. Modified structures that persist become institutionalized with influence that extends across time and space (Germonprez and Zigurs 2009). Structures that are reified through multiple episodes become the new norm as they redefine the structures for adaptation. These persistent structures are a legacy from structuration episodes that serve as raw material for future use and adaptation.\n",

            "Modes of Adaptation Structuration episodes for the process block in our theoretical model (Figure 2) are carried out through two distinct types of adaptation behaviors: technology adaptation and task adaptation. While adaptation by the general user population is typically gradual and incremental, there are outliers where the confluence of motivation, opportunity, and capability lead to significant transformation (Tyre and Orlikowski 1994). An examination of user adaptation behaviors must therefore recognize this difference, and explicitly accommodate adjustments that are mostly subtle, yet sometimes dramatic. The exploration–exploitation modes outlined in organizational learning literature (March 1991), where the locality and depth of knowledge differentiate the mode of adaptation (Benner and Tushman 2002), resonate with the duality of structure concept. In the recursive structuration process, two modes of behavior can be seen operating with cross-purposes. The first is exploitive adaptation guided by existing norms to yield\n",

            "usage episodes aligned with existing interpretations. Exploitation is associated with incremental improvements so that existing needs are serviced better (O’Reilly and Tushman 2004). The second is an exploratory possibility whereby each interaction episode allows actors to apply nonstandard interpretations leading to divergent structures with potentially dramatic consequences. This mode of adaptation develops unexpected solutions and triggers a shift to different task or technology trajectories associated with frame-breaking consequences that substantially alter the existing way of doing things (Orlikowski 2000). The distinction among the modes of adaptation comes into focus as exploitive behaviors deal with something that resembles the existing spirit and core capability whereas exploratory behaviors involve a transition to something that disregards convention in that workplace. The spirit as understood by an individual establishes the boundary between exploitive behaviors and exploratory behaviors.3\n",

            "Topology of Adaptation Behaviors To capture the diversity of adaptive behaviors available to individuals, we conceptualize two overlapping dimensions, the first involving the objects of adaptation (task or technology) and the second capturing the mode of adaptation (exploitive or exploratory). We depict this two dimensional topology of adaptation behaviors in Figure 4. The task region involves those adaptations that alter or introduce new task and work process structures. The technology region involves adapting capabilities, both actual and perceived, of the IT object.4 The exploration–exploitation distinction is characterized by both the locality of knowledge and understood spirit. Adaptation, like learning, may be ambidextrous in that it sometimes combines elements of both exploitation and exploration. The distinction has demonstrated conceptual clarity in the domains of organizational learning (van Wijk et al. 2012), individual learning (Dam and Körding 2009), firm level innovation (He and Wong 2004), and individuals managing innovation teams (Mom et al. 2009) that we believe is applicable to user adaptation behaviors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Scholars addressing post-adoption adaptation offer a diverse vocabulary to describe the actions and behaviors involved (see Table A1 in Appendix A). However, these characterizations emerged in the absence of a theoretical frame. As a result, existing characterizations are largely incomplete, integrating only a subset of adaptation behaviors available to individuals. In the absence of a crisp theoretical lens, many researchers combine adaptation concepts into a single measure, even when an analytical distinction is initiated. Our topology of adaptation behaviors provides a framework for organizing and clarifying task–technology adaptation and encompasses adaptation behaviors identified piecewise in previous literature. Based on ASTI and this topology, we propose research hypotheses that relate adaptation behaviors to performance. Exploitive technology adaptation (I-TECH) occurs when a user modifies technology features consistent with how s/he perceives is intended or standard for the technology. Exploitive technology adaptations can be understood as subtle and progressive optimization along a predictable path related to an understood spirit. It begins with subtle changes to interpretational understanding of a technological object and the existential nature of agentive functions (Faulkner and Runde 2009). Expanding one’s understanding presents additional appropriation choices and an extended set of capabilities that modify the practical potential of the technology in a specific usage context, even as the artifact itself does not change. Exploitive technology adaptation also includes customization and personalization through configuration options exposed to the user (Desouza et al. 2007). By engaging contingent affordances embedded in the object, users are making different choices of which features to use and how.\n",

Furthermore, the role of knowledge and learning is captured in the exploration–exploitation dynamic.\n",

            "Finally, exploitive behaviors alter tangential features that do not transform the core identity of the technology (Griffith 1999). While the user has limited domain knowledge of the technology, the demands for such knowledge and related skills are generally low for this behavior. From the introduction example, Jane is leveraging existing technology features to take photographs that supplement a written description. The result is a shift from low fidelity textual description to a much higher fidelity characterization of items in the inventory. More examples of this adaptation involve the shift from synchronous phone calls to asynchronous e-mail or manipulation of the camera’s exposure settings and post-processing color correction. These exploitive adaptations introduce different technical capabilities and combinations into structuration episodes yet remain within the spirit of the technology. Certainty, speed, proximity, and clarity of feedback tie exploitation to its consequences quickly and precisely (March 1991). Returns are positive, predictable, and usually considered low risk, with a small variance in outcome. In a longitudinal study, Kraut et al. (1989) found that limited technology change can have a major positive effect on personal job performance. Overall, exploitive technology adaptations generate largely proximal results by engaging features and capabilities gradually toward predictable and positive outcomes. Therefore, H1: Exploitive technology adaptation is positively associated with performance. Exploitive task adaptation (I-TASK) occurs when a user attempts to modify existing task processes while adhering to the current structure and target objective of those work processes. Exploitive task adaptations enable an existing objective and typically involve evolutionary and incremental process changes that follow a predictable or natural progression. This behavior generates incremental refinement and extension of existing task paradigms, with returns that are positive, proximate, and predictable (Benner and Tuschman 2002). Exploitive task adaptations are minor changes to the work process steps, where the inertia of the existing task is maintained. Extended and integrative forms of use (Saga and Zmud 1994) involve doing more of the existing task or doing the task better and with higher quality. This behavior embraces definitive adjustments to existing work processes while accommodating a new technology. From the introduction example, Jane’s basic work task is to collect and deliver inventory to the office. Jane modifies the conventional task processes by phoning important information early during her visit. In a subsequent task adaptation, she arranges early delivery of the entire inventory while she is still in the field. Individuals engaging in exploitive task adap-\n",

            "tation behavior are operating in the familiar knowledge domain. In a workplace setting, employees have deep domain expertise of their primary tasks. This familiarity facilitates positive exploitive task adaptation (van Wijk et al. 2012). In a multisite case study, Orlikowski (2000) reported that “application enactment” (where people choose to refine their existing ways of doing things) results in noticeable improvements in effectiveness and efficiency. Overall, exploitive task adaptation manipulates work process where the user has deep domain knowledge. Therefore, H2: Exploitive task adaptation is positively associated with performance. The full benefit of an IT can only be realized by doing new things (Ward et al. 2008). Exploratory task adaptation (R-TASK) occurs when a user attempts to transform current task processes while generating new target objectives for the work processes. This behavior gives a user opportunity to explore new ways of restructuring task processes. By making changes to deep structure, user modification of work processes and procedures enable a more complete assimilation of an IT (Lassila and Brancheau 1999). This includes application to different work tasks and new processes not intended or expected during infusion of a technology. More extreme than I-TASK, these modifications can establish entirely new task structures, extending structures for adaptation to new settings and different tasks. The outcome is new possibilities in quantity, quality, and variety not practical or possible before the adaptation (Saga and Zmud 1994). From the introduction example, Jane demonstrated exploratory task adaptation by delivering inventory and descriptions to an Internet auction site. While this business process change became viable with the availability of images, engaging the technical features of photography was not inherently coupled with an entry into web commerce. Exploring web auction sites stands alone as a distinct work system change with the potential to reach a vast number of customers across the globe. While task flexibility has been linked to negative outcomes at the group level (Wheeler and Valacich 1996), there is reason to believe the aggregate outcome for exploratory task adaptation by individuals will be positive. In a competitive workplace environment where positive performance is rewarded, a results oriented bias encourages individual actions with positive outcomes. In addition, task familiarity is linked with positive group performance through individual member ability (Littlepage et al. 1997). Broad task knowledge possessed by users in their work domain brings greater control to guide positive outcomes. Users are often able to anticipate consequences as they apply technology features to new uses, such that these opportunistic interventions have predictable direct effects on\n",

Indeed, prior task familiarity and domain-relevant skills are a boundary condition for individual creativity leading to positive results (Chang et al. 2012). Individual behavior is channeled by the combination of domain knowledge and performance bias. Therefore, H3: Exploratory task adaptation is positively associated with performance. There is a distinction between technology adaptations that operate on existing features by manipulating predefined capabilities and changes which create something new (Desouza et al. 2007). Exploratory technology adaptation (R-TECH) occurs when a user devises new technology features that s/he perceives as unusual or that depart from standard for the technology. Unlike exploitive adaptation where a user is consciously operating in the context of the understood spirit, exploratory adaptations are performed without regard for the spirit of a technology. While an experienced inventor may be targeting universal novelty, a lay user does not emphasize that as an objective. Rather, the lay user considers the status quo and standard spirit as they understand it to be the reference point from which they diverge when embarking on exploratory behaviors. This conceptualization is not meant to position exploratory technology adaptation as deviant in the sense of a schoolyard bully. Instead, R-TECH behaviors develop and create nonstandard ways of interpreting the technology that are qualitatively different than that which previously existed. Behaviors to create or enable new functional capabilities engage fundamental change to the core principles of the artifact (Kallinikos et al. 2013). By changing a technology toward a nonstandard or unintended capability, exploratory technology adaptation seeks to add functionality that did not previously exist or that the provider had intended to be unavailable. Such adaptations create entirely new perceptions of utility and place the technology artifact on a new performance trajectory. From the introduction example, Jill is combining spreadsheet, images, and cloud storage to transform the phone from a communication and information delivery device to a repository of record and platform for collaborative analysis. As a result, the phone takes on an entirely new trajectory of productivity consequences. The powerful potential of user-driven adaptation is highlighted by research showing ordinary users tend to generate more original ideas delivering novel functions with a higher perceived value than developers with professional experience (von Hippel 2005). However, exploratory technology development benefits from experience and technical knowledge. Ordinary users, without a deep or specific knowledge in the technology domain, have a limited ability to manage the high technological complexities involved (Lettl\n",
            "\n",
            "2007). Where the difference between novice and expert is tied to domain and discipline knowledge, users that depend almost exclusively on conceptual knowledge are typically less capable than even novice professionals (Alexander 1992). As a result, technology exploration involves risk-taking on the part of the user. Consequences are often unforeseen with returns that are distant and less certain (Kang and Snell 2009). While users may intend positive results, their limited knowledge and experience in the technology domain suggests outcomes for this behavior will be volatile. Thus, either positive or negative consequences may emerge with no specific hypothesized effect of R-TECH justified. Mediation Through Task Adaptation As indicated in our model in Figure 2, task adaptation is theorized to mediate the effect of technology adaptation on performance. Scholars report that optimizing the value of technology requires complimentary adaptation of task processes (Goh et al. 2011; Majchrzak et al. 2000). At the level of individuals, performance outcomes do not emerge from technology alone. A sequential relationship from technology adaptation to task adaptation is important when considering performance outcomes of individuals. While an organization may plausibly accrue advantage from improved technologies alone (e.g., cost), an individual’s performance is obtained through their involvement in a task. The “fit as mediation” stream of task–technology fit literature (Venkatraman 1989) recognizes performance as accrued through strategy and conduct. Applied at the level of individuals, this perspective positions workplace task processes in the strategy and conduct mediation role. Inanimate technology must be activated by a human agent to be effective, and it is through application to a task that a user defines technology and gives it meaning (Orlikowski 1992). The reverse, however, does not hold. Tasks can be performed with different technologies and, in many cases, with no technology artifact at all. Saga and Zmud (1994) posit a temporal relationship triggered by experience whereby technology adaptation leads to task adaptation. As users engage more technology features, they gain knowledge that enhances their capacity for using the technology in an innovative manner to support task performance. Building on this viewpoint, Wang and Hsieh (2006) found statistical support in their retrospective study of ERP projects that emergent use (I-TASK: “using a technology in an innovative manner to support an individual’s task performance” p. 735) arises after extended use (I-TECH: “using more of the technology features” p. 735). In a longitudinal study Kraut et al. (1989) found that many technology change effects are the result of accompanying changes in task procedures. Bhattacherjee and Harris (2009) found the benefit of technology adaptation is fully realized only when\n",

            "the user “initiates corresponding changes to their own work structures to accommodate and take advantage of an adaptable IT” (p. 43). Furthermore, these adjustments have effects that emerge over a series of discrete change cycles (LeonardBarton 1988). Consider our introductory example of the series of exploitive technology adaptations Jane applied to progress from audio phone calls, to still photos, then movies. When these technology changes are aimed at the task of information delivery to the office, the potential value is positive and predictable. Yet, no matter how fast or media rich the communications to the office become, the benefits are tied to that task process and the affiliated business strategy. When Jane applies those same technology adaptations in the new task of delivering information directly to customers through web auction sites, the potential outcomes are transformational. The organization encounters a new business strategy with expanded reach to new customers and marketplaces worldwide. The technology adaptations themselves have no outcome significance by themselves. Only when complimentary task adaptations are made to accommodate the technology change do performance implications arise. Furthermore, the magnitude of performance outcome from those technology changes is largely determined by the work task engaged. Engaging new and different work tasks has great potential importance, particularly for ordinary users who have extensive information about the task domain and as a class tend to develop innovations with high originality, novelty, and value (von Hippel 2005). Furthermore, the strong cognitive absorption required for these combined adaptation behaviors is associated with positive performance (Burton-Jones and Straub 2006). Therefore, H4: The effect of exploitive technology adaptation is mediated by (a) exploitive task adaptation and (b) exploratory task adaptation and positively associated with performance. The uncertain nature of exploratory technology adaptation brings a greater variation than the more subtle exploitive change. Despite the disparity in potential, ultimately it is the work process that results in outcomes (Thomas and Bostrom 2010). Orlikowski (2000) used the term change enactment to describe a user’s intentional choice to apply new technology in an effort to substantially alter an existing way of doing things (R-TASK). She found that where the intent of the user is focused on existing work processes (I-TASK), technology adaptation behavior is not transformational but reinforcing with enhancement effects. Bygstad (2005) reported in his longitudinal study of software development that the determining innovation of IS projects is not the technology but the working solution as facilitated by business process adaptation.

            "While most technologies and tasks may be open to some form of adaptation, all users are not equally positioned to initiate adaptation behaviors. A predisposition for behaviors originating from personality is an important factor for certain individuals performing exploitation and exploration activities (Raisch et al. 2009). Personality is defined as a “stable set of characteristics and tendencies that determine peoples’ commonalities and differences in thoughts, feeling, and actions” (McElroy et al. 2007, p. 810). Personality is often studied by use of the five factor model (FFM) which describes five overarching traits of openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism which are theorized to encapsulate the essence of one’s personality (Digman 1990). Some individuals are intrinsically motivated to pursue creative behaviors for intellectual stimulation and as a creative outlet (von Hippel 2005), which is captured by the openness to experience factor of the FFM. When studying the trait of innovativeness, Agarwal and Prasad (1998) developed a domain-specific measure, personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology (PIIT), defined as “the willingness of an individual to try out any new information technology” (p. 206). Personal innovativeness is associated with exploitive interactions where users leverage existing knowledge (Yi et al. 2006). In the case of exploitive adaptation, PIIT is capturing a user’s implicit tendencies to engage the understood spirit of a technology. Some scholars characterize individual innovativeness as a moderator (Sun 2012). However, comparative research reveals it more reliably functions as a direct determinant (Yi et al. 2006) with strong causal influence on behavior (Wu et al. 2011). Therefore, H6a: Personal innovativeness with information technology (PIIT) has a positive association with exploitive technology adaptation.\n",

            "The tendencies originating from personal innovativeness are also relevant for users pursuing substantive change to technology (Karahanna et al. 2006). Innovation is inherently associated with greater risks, uncertainty, and imprecision (Kirton 1976). Innovative individuals are more willing to accept the risk associated with trying something new (Moore 1999), actively seek information about new ideas from a wide range of sources, are better able to cope with uncertainty, and are better able to envision the potential benefits of innovation (Yi et al. 2006). PIIT embodies the risk-taking propensity of individuals with regard to IT use (Agarwal and Prasad 1998). Furthermore, PIIT is associated with exploratory interactions that involve new knowledge creation (Nambisan et al. 1999). Collecting more information can provide inspiration for IT adaptation (Hirschman 1980). To the extent that PIIT reflects risk-taking where exploratory interactions are the target, it is functioning differently than PIIT for exploitive engagement where the user is working within the understood spirit of the technology. Users with high PIIT pursue I-TASK as a means to an end, whereas R-TASK is a primary goal. Therefore, H6b: Personal Innovativeness with information technology (PIIT) has a positive association with exploratory technology adaptation.\n",

            "Individuals with high levels of self-efficacy are more committed to achieving goals (Morin and Latham 2000), more persistent when confronted with difficulties (Schaefers et al. 1997), and take more initiative gathering information to expand their technology knowledge (Wang et al. 2013). A positive affective attitude toward the risk-taking unknowns of a technology move the CSE relationship beyond the understood spirit toward exploratory adaptation. Krueger and Dickson (1994) found that individuals with high self-efficacy tend to observe more opportunities in high risk circumstances and as a result take more risks. Bandura and Wood (1989) found that individuals with high self-efficacy assess obstacles as a learning experience and therefore develop perseverance. High CSE individuals who are willing to research and gather additional technology-related information are more likely to engage in exploratory adaptation behaviors that diverge from the understood spirit of a technology. Therefore, H7b: Technology-specific computer self-efficacy has a positive association with exploratory technology adaptation.\n",
            "\n",
            "In IT literature, affect is often measured by one’s attitudes toward technology use. One example is computer selfefficacy (CSE), defined as one’s belief that s/he has the ability to use technology (Compeau et al. 1999). CSE has a substantial influence on emotional responses such that high computer self-efficacy is associated with high levels of affect and lower levels of anxiety toward computer use. The relationship extends to adaptation usage, where the affective arousal associated with growing self-efficacy motivates more interaction with the technology (Compeau et al. 1999). In the introductory example, Jane’s successful introduction of still photos enhances her smartphone self-efficacy which in turn encourages additional adaptations in the form of adjusted exposure settings and color correction. CSE evolves in response to interaction and experiences, propelling extended interaction through its influence on competence (Shih 2006), perceived control (Teo and Pok 2003), reduced anxiety (Igbaria and Iivari 1995), and even hedonic enjoyment (AlNatour and Benbasat 2009). When a user’s affective state with regard to the existing spirit of the technology is high, they are more inclined to take full advantage of features available within technology. Therefore, H7a: Technology-specific computer self-efficacy has a positive association with exploitive technology adaptation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Where PIIT captures a predisposition to innovate with IT, and CSE measures an individual’s current willingness and motivation for cognitive and deep structure engagement of a technology, neither capture an individual’s capability to undertake adaptation behaviors. Knowledge and understanding of technology is an important enabler for effective integration and optimization (Duncan 1995). In the opening example, we see that Jane first uses her phone to verbally call in inventory items. Based upon experience, she discovers this does not work when her coworkers are unavailable to take the call. Subsequently she engages in more effective exploitive adaptation as she employs her phone to take and deliver images asynchronously via e-mail. While ordinary users generally lack deep technical understanding about new technologies, repeated experiences facilitate knowledge creation about the technology (Nambisan et al. 1999). The association between experience and exploitive adaptation reveals the extent to which use within the understood sprit depends upon knowledge building. Therefore, H8a: Experience with a technology has a positive relationship with exploitive technology adaptation.\n",

Survey questions are cast in terms of the user’s current mobile phone, setting a technological starting point for all respondents. With their capabilities as general purpose computing devices and their advantages in portability, social interactivity, and interconnectivity, smartphones are an ideal collaboration platform (Ahmadi et al. 2008). Additionally, smartphones offer a wide range of possibilities for technology adaptation that is readily accessible, including for users with limited technology training (DesAutels 2011). Similarly, we use the contextual framing of survey questions to impose a manipulation control on task characteristics. Each question asks respondents to consider their use of mobile phones in a work related context. Yuan et al. (2010) identified multiple work related applications of contemporary smartphones including communication, information searching, transaction processing, and office functionality. While all questions are framed relative to the domain of work tasks, we have not constrained the respondents to a single task. The theoretical model posits that individuals bring knowledge, skills, abilities, personality traits, and affective biases into a usage environment. Recognizing that a survey will\n",

We employ the frequently used PIIT construct with the established four-item scale of PIIT validated by Agarwal and Prasad (1998) (see Appendix B). We use computer self-efficacy as a proxy for affect in our model. Following the guidance of Marakas et al. (2007), we devise a set of items to encompass the dimensions of CSE relevant to smartphones (see Appendix B). Whereas general accumulative affect influences usage behaviors broadly, carefully tuned measures of CSE focused on the user relationship with a specific IT are only predictive of interactions with that technology. Therefore, CSE as operationalized here will predict technology adaptation behaviors but not task adaptation behavior. The final individual characteristic is experience (EXP). Smartphones during the time of our study are advancing quickly, both in terms of the intended customizations and personalization options, as well as core capabilities that motivated users can manipulate. As a result, we have chosen not to measure general experience with mobile phones. Instead, the number of months a respondent has had their current smartphone serves as an objective proxy for experience with the technology. These individual characteristics, along with controls for technology and task, anchor the input side of our study. Process Constructs Processing activities involve the manifest behaviors defined in the topology of adaptation behaviors. A theory based accounting of adaptation behaviors during usage episodes and their impact on performance is a new contribution to the literature and the focus of our investigation. Survey scales aligned with the topology have been developed to capture the unique characteristics of each behavior. Through a multistep process including several rounds of pilot testing and peer review (detailed in Appendix C), we converged on items for each construct. Output Constructs Output from structuration episodes takes the form of performance outcomes, improvisational sources of structure, and new persistent structures. Since we are modeling structures for adaptation as antecedents in a variance model, we focus on performance effects as a dependent variable. The dependent variable performance (PERF) is a universally valued outcome in workplace settings. Sampling a cross section of users in many settings presents a challenge normalizing actual performance. We follow the tradition of earlier studies by\n",

Operationalizing perceived performance is done using the “short scale” of relative advantage validated by Moore and Benbasat (1991) and replicated by others (Goodhue and Thompson 1995; Kim et al. 2009). This measure simultaneously captures anticipated performance outcomes that guide user behavior, as well the feedback obtained during a usage episode that either confirms or denies user expectation. Control Variables In addition to the theorized constructs described above, a set of control variables were collected to add robustness by parceling their variance from perceived performance. Controls include demographic variables of age, gender, and education. We also measured the user’s perception of the number of features (FEAT) available on their mobile phone. This factor may be important for multiple reasons, including possible direct effect on performance (Jasperson et al. 2005). Alternately, perceived feature limitations may be an impediment to a user’s intention to try (Ahuja and Thatcher 2005), and thereby attenuate task adaptation behaviors. While near ubiquity of smartphones during the study period minimizes the importance of this control variable, there are limitedfunction phones still in use.\n",

Effects of Process Variables The research model is analyzed to simultaneously assess direct and indirect effects and establish statistical significance for hypothesis testing. Data analyzed in this sample reveals exploitive technology adaptation has no statistically significant (p = 0.057) relationship with PERF, suggesting that H1 should be rejected. We also found strong positive relationships (p < 0.001) for both task adaptation behaviors and performance, supporting H2 and H3. In order to provide contrast with I-TECH, we performed an exploratory test of R-TECH and found a statistically significant (p = 0.032) positive relationship to PERF. Mediation testing follows the bootstrap-t method to calculate standard errors, parameter estimates, and T-scores that establish p-values for indirect effects (MacKinnon et al. 2004). This method also provides the indirect effect sizes (medium), and total effect sizes (approaching large). Relevant statistics for this test are presented in Table 2. Alternate tests for mediation (detailed in Appendix D) include the product-of-coefficients “delta” method and the distributionof-products M-test which accounts for non-normal distribution. All tests support the conclusion of significant indirect effects for H4a, H4b, H5a, and H5b. Effect of Input Variables Antecedent factors associated with individual characteristics reveal the importance of stable personality traits. We find statistically significant relationship between PIIT and both technology adaptation behaviors (p # 0.001). These findings support H6a and H6b. The affective characteristic of smartphone-specific CSE is significantly associated with exploitive technology adaptation I-TECH (p = 0.011), but not R-TECH (p = 0.419). This supports H7a between accumulative affect and exploitive technology adaptation. Responses in this study do not support H7b and the expected relationship between CSE and exploratory technology adaptation. Overall, the effect sizes for PIIT are medium high (I-TECH f2 = 0.27; R-TECH f2 = 0.31) and appear to be much more important than the effects of CSE on I-TECH (f2 = 0.10). The last antecedent studied is experience. The number of months with the current smartphone is not significantly related to exploitive technology adaptation (p = 0.480), suggesting rejection of H8a.

Our measure of experience does not account for demonstrations and instruction received at the point of sale, which may provide sufficient contextual knowledge to engage in exploitive adaptation. We do find that experience has a significant positive relationship with exploratory technology adaptation (p < 0.048) in support of H8b. Nonlinear and Post Hoc Results Additional models and methods applied to test the nonlinear relationship between EXP and R-TECH are detailed in Appendix D. A quadratic relationship is modeled from EXP to R-TECH to complete the test of an inverted U relationship proposed in hypothesis H8b. In addition, exploratory nonlinear relationships are examined from the four adaptation constructs to PERF. The resulting path model was assessed using WarpPLS (Kock 2015) to confirm the nature of the polynomial relationships (statistics reported in Table 3). A subsequent multivariate OLS regression was conducted to calculate linear and nonlinear coefficients (statistics detailed in Table 4). The nonlinear path model reveals a statistically significant (p = 0.005) inverted U relationship between EXP and R-TECH. Figure 6 depicts the bivariate relationship. Exploratory adaptations build over time then recede, as routines become habits. The effect size is understandably muted as the positive effects early are partially offset by negative effects later.

Individuals surveyed by our study proactively engage malleable IT with performance enhancing adaptations to both technology and workplace tasks. The diversity of paths (some significant, others not; some linear, others not) support our characterization that adaptation behaviors function independently. Differentiating the four adaptation behaviors provides insight to the mechanisms through which structuration engages with technology and task to establish fit unique to each usage episode. Previous scholars observe the full advantage of IT for organizations is accrued in partnership with task adaptation (Bygstad 2005; Leonard-Barton 1988). Our study extends these ideas at the level of individuals to expose the gateway role of task adaptation as a mediator for technology adaptation.

Our results provide strong empirical support for the overall research model with good predictive capability that explains 60 percent of the variance in performance. This is an important first step in establishing the proposed ASTI theory. Having validated the primary relationships in the theory, we realize that the base model is silent on boundary conditions and the nature of the relationships which may be linear or otherwise. Observing that both I-TECH and R-TECH have almost equal effects on I-TASK and R-TASK which, in turn, have almost equal effects on performance, motivated a post hoc analysis for each adaptation behavior to provide additional texture.\n",

Our exploratory assessment finds a positive relationship between R-TECH and PERF. Motivated users are engaging in productive artifact modification in a way not seen in the past. This study reveals the potential of malleable IT to recast old assumptions. Our data reveals another insight of how individuals in our study are engaging exploratory technology adaptation behaviors. The nonlinear relationship (see Figure 7, right side) exposes positive performance effects for weak and strong R-TECH, but somewhat equivocal in the middle range. This may be rooted in a transition in the decision-making processes that novice innovators employ when performing exploratory adaptation. Weak R-TECH is plausibly dependent upon intuition of the novice, whereas strong R-TECH is a more deliberative engagement (Alexander 1992). While cognitive style theory suggests that some individuals favor an intuitive problem solving approach while others favor a systematic approach using a deliberatively rational and logical style (Kirton 1976), this study supports the view that individuals may engage both intuitive and systematic problem solving (Scott and Bruce 1994). The equivocal middle region suggests the transition from one style to the other is neither sudden nor smooth.\n",

In contrast, the data support a consistently linear relationship for R-TASK. Two phenomena may be contributing to the diminishing returns of exploitive task adaptation. The first is limits on decisionmaking authority. Where freedom is limited, the performance upside from adaptation is limited. In the domain of individuals adapting their workplace tasks, it is easy to understand that the flexibility and authority of young professionals (the population sampled in this study) to reconfigure specific workplace tasks may be constrained at the upper end. A similar phenomenon involving individual managers has been reported, whereby limits on decision-making authority place an upper limit on ambidexterity among individual managers (Mom et al. 2009; Raisch et al. 2009).

Contemporary information technologies in particular draw individuals into an intimate usage dynamic where adaptation behaviors abound. This relationship, previously observed among exceptional users, is becoming commonplace. Our theory-guided decomposition of adaptation behaviors provides a solid foundation to investigate individual user interactions with malleable IT. Conceptualized within structuration episodes, these variations of use extend adaptive structuration theory and its mechanism of appropriation to the level of individuals to describe a rich usage landscape for malleable IT. This investigation of young workers provides empirical support for our proposed theory and validates the application of AST to the domain of individuals interacting with malleable IT.\n",

Acknowledging the distinction among these constructs helps explain confounding results from earlier studies. Ahuja and Thatcher (2005) found that experience was not related to trying to innovate with IT. However, our study shows that disaggregating exploratory and exploitive adaptation behaviors reveals a significant relationship between experience and exploratory but not exploitive adaptation. Barki et al. (2007) failed to find a theorized relationship between an aggregate task–technology adaptation construct and IS use related activity. We show that task adaptation behaviors function separately from technology adaptation behaviors. Furthermore, the nonlinear effects of I-TASK and R-TECH exposed in post hoc analysis reveal the complexity that may have confounded these earlier studies. Our theoretical and empirical efforts provide preliminary evidence that, at the individual level, structuration becomes dynamic through the adaptation behaviors of users. The adaptive structuration process of groups advanced by DeSanctis and Pool (1994) is manifest at the individual level in these four adaptation behaviors. These behaviors are the mechanisms with which structures are engaged, interpreted, manipulated, and reconstructed. By realigning task and technology structures, users are not constrained to a static fit, but rather construct a performance reality anew with each episode of use. The task–technology fit (TTF) theoretical model (Goodhue and Thompson 1995) resonates with ASTI. Objects of adaptation are the same antecedent factors found in TTF. TTF identifies a latent concept of fit that mediates performance. ASTI recasts fit from a static characteristic of an a priori match to a dynamic phenomenon determined within structuration episodes by individuals. This perspective links the literatures of task–technology fit, adaptive structuration theory, and task–technology adaptation to provide a theory with greater insight at the individual level. According to AST, it is actual use enacted during appropriation that determines performance (Dennis et al. 2001). ASTI provides the insight that adaptation behaviors empower users to dynamically redefine fit and, as a result, performance.\n",

            "Projecting AST to the Level of Individuals Just as AST captures the duality of structure, ASTI (summarized in Table 5) observes that structures for adaptation both influence adaptation behaviors and are redefined by adaptation behaviors during structuration episodes. This is an important extension of AST that develops the ideas of structuration to the rarely applied level of individuals and thereby opens new perspectives to assess the relationship users have with IT. ASTI presents a recursive process that explains mechanisms underlying the iterative innovation outcomes reported by many scholars (Leonard and Sensiper 1998, Leonard-Barton 1988; Leonardi 2011). Each usage event may reinforce existing structures or, through structuration episodes employing adaptation behaviors, improvise new possibilities.\n",

However, some scholars examining the duality of structure argue that technology is an occasion for structuring and represents an important trigger (Barley 1986). Others posit that technology possesses structures that bring their own meaning into interaction episodes (Scapens and Macintosh 1996). ASTI casts malleable information technology as a first order participant in the structuration process and thereby advances a liberal interpretation. This view of technology engages the debate involving the application of structuration theory to sociotechnical systems. The criticism relates to the conflation of structure and agency (Bostrom et al. 2009). Our characterization of task adaptation and technology adaptation draws a clear distinction between the role of technology as an agent of structural influence and the role of technology as a recipient of structural influence. During task adaptation, technology is an agent of influence, with structural values and biases imposed into the usage setting. Alternately, during technology adaptation, the artifact is the recipient of influence as the user imposes their values and biases into the reconstituted technology. The direction of transference is distinct and provides an element of clarity to structure and agency embodied in the duality of technology. Our work also speaks to a second criticism related to structuration theory’s inability to explain why certain structures succeed and become institutionalized (Bostrom et al. 2009). Complimentary adaptation under the control of individual users provides insight and a starting point for possible resolution. Institutionalization does not follow deterministically from the emergence of transient structures. Rather it is the ability of emergent structures to support outcomes valued by individuals that qualifies structures for reification in subsequent structuration episodes.\n",

            "Malleable IT is invading businesses in unexpected and unplanned ways as BYOD trends enter organizations of all shapes and sizes (King 2014). The debate within many companies revolves around the cost of data security versus the savings from moving devices off of company balance sheets (Tokuyoshi 2013). Our study suggests a third component of this discussion should be the post-adoption potential of malleable IT. The adaptive possibilities of newly empowered employees should not be overlooked. The unexpected and unforeseeable adaptations by users who manipulate technology and task structures extend the potential of smartphones, tablets, and other forms of malleable IT. Utility for these technologies is not fixed, but emerges during structuration episodes pursued by individual users. In this environment, organizations may consider responses in several directions. The first is to manage and contain the security risks that accompany nonstandard adaptations by continuously ratcheting up technology constraints. Some organizations have already begun requiring employees deploy mobile device management technologies on any personal device used for company business. Often these approaches try to control company information while allowing employees to creatively apply personal devices for nonproprietary information. An alternate nontechnical approach involves addressing behavioral risks through training and awareness. Such methods are already pursued by many organizations in a range of areas including business ethics, sexual harassment, and data security. The widespread diffusion of malleable IT suggests that organizations should extend their training and awareness campaigns to this additional domain of adaptation. Finally, organizations can get out front of employees by sponsoring forums and even competitions for adaptations appli-\n",

            "The current study is limited to task structures and technology structures, but does not directly model or investigate adaptation associated with the potentially relevant domain of the user. IS literature suggests that adaptation of the individual user (Barki et al. 2007) may be distinct from adaptation of task or technology. Indeed, cognitive changes to knowledge, skill, and ability resulting from trial and error or training represent potentially relevant adaptations within individuals. Other scholars have explored IT innovation by users as a knowledge creation process (Nambisan et al. 1999), with findings consistent with the persistent structures for adaptation envisioned by ASTI. This limitation is largely mitigated as the measured task and technology changes capture the behavioral manifestation of user change. Furthermore, the construct of CSE embraces the emotional consequences from change in skills and abilities. Assessing the antecedent effects of individual skills and abilities across the landscape of adaptation within structuration episodes remains open for future study. Other variants of personal characteristics, such as individual absorptive capacity instead of CSE, may provide an interesting alternate accumulative factor (Lavie and Rosenkopf 2006). The ability to value, assimilate, and apply external knowledge enhances exploration at the firm level and may function similarly for individuals. A more detailed assessment of triggers for individual adaptation would build and enhance the ideas of ASTI, as was done for AST at the level of groups and organizations (Thomas and Bostrom 2010). Some portions of the ASTI model are not directly measured in this study. This includes the constructs of task characteristics and transient structures for adaptation. We made the decision to focus on the central constructs of structuration episodes and leave a more complete accounting of peripheral constructs for future studies. Similar decisions were made by other scholars working with and extending AST (Dennis et al. 2001; DeSanctis and Poole 1994).\n",

Drawing upon structuration theory, this study provides a framework for unpacking task–technology adaptation across multiple dimensions. Building on this topology of four adaptation behaviors, we extend the literature of AST to the level of an individual, and decompose the mechanisms of structuration episodes for malleable IT. An example research project was undertaken to provide a proof of concept for this individual level framework, finding support and more insightful results than what prior research and theory offer. This empirical investigation supports the notion that adaptation of technology structures influence performance outcomes through the complimentary yet distinct adaptation of task structures. In addition to opening AST at the level of individuals, insights from this study address important criticisms of structuration theory as applied to the study of information systems.\n",

First order effect of new technology is to substitute technology for human action. Second order effect of new technology is to increase the overall amount of a task. The third order effect of new technology is to facilitate the emergence of new coordination structures and tasks. Routinization: Alterations that occur within work systems to account for IT applications such that these applications are no longer perceived as new or out-of-the ordinary. Extended use: Using more of the technology’s features in order to accommodate a more comprehensive set of work tasks. Integrative use: Using the technology in order to establish or enhance work flow linkages among a set of work tasks.

            "Concept Changing the technology: To change substantial attributes of the software. Individual Feature Adoption: Explicit acceptance by an individual that s/he will use the technology to carry out assigned work task. Individual feature extension: Individuals discover ways to apply features that go beyond the uses delineated by designers. Emergent use: Using a technology in an innovative manner to support an individual’s task performance. Extended use: Using more of the technology features to support an individual’s task performance. Personalization: Changes to the technology artifact by modifying predefined user options to meet the needs of the individual user. Customization: Changes to the technology artifact by modifying predefined user options to meet the needs of a collected setting. Invention: Changes to the technology artifact by creating add-ins or using existing functions for novel purposes. Exaptation: Changes to develop novel functionalities or discover things not conceived by the technology’s designers, or use things in unintended ways. Stop doing things: The organization can stop doing things that are no longer necessary. Doing things better: The organization can improve the performance of activities it must continue to do. Doing new things: The organization, its staff, or trading partners can do new things, or do things in new ways that were not previously possible. Work adaptation: User’s appropriation and modification of relevant work structures in order to accommodate the target IT. IT adaptation: The extent to which a system is modified by its users to fit their personal needs, preferences, and work patterns. Task adaptation: The degree to which users modify their work. This can be done either by changing existing work routines and procedures or by adding activities to their jobs (i.e., doing things better). Adapting the technology: Changing its functionalities and features. Tailoring in use: The act of modifying computer applications during the context of use. Team technology adaptation: A process in which a team changes the way it uses one or more information and communications technology (ICT) for accomplishing its work. User-Generated Information System: A set of component services, integrated by the user into a novel configuration such that the resulting information services is (1) qualitatively different from its components and (2) offers unique value to the user over and above the value of its inputs.\n",

Survey data collection was selected in order to examine data from a diverse set of technology users. The choice of smart phones as the technology platform necessitated polling a set of users who possess sufficient familiarity with the technology that position them as potential candidates for adaptive behaviors. Generational differences suggested that young adults were ideal candidates, whereas older adults (particularly senior citizens) may stereotype phones into a single use scenario. We chose to target working graduate students whose participation was solicited during scheduled breaks in an evening business school master’s degree program at a major metropolitan university. By targeting this population, the study design manipulated both the age range and the work related usage conditions. We further manipulated work-related usage with a filter question in the survey. By designing the study to be administered during a classroom lecture break, we were constrained in the time available. As a result, the number of questions in the final survey was reduced to small sets of items commensurate with our confidence in the scales.\n",

            "Independent Variables\n",
            "Independent variables involve familiar measures, starting with persistent personality traits. Personal innovativeness with IT is adapted directly from that proposed by Agarwal and Prasad (1998). The four item scale was reworded to specify “mobile phone technologies” to maintain a psychometric control on a specific technology artifact and its associated structures. As originally proposed, this scale included a negatively coded third item. In the context of mobile technologies, this item did not converge adequately with the rest of the latent constructs and is omitted from the full path analysis. The remaining three items provide ample power to capture the reflective construct, and have been similarly used by other scholars (Hong et al. 2011). The second independent variable is accumulative Affect. We followed the formulaic guidance of Marakas et al. (2007) to devise a new scale for computer self-efficacy tuned to the functional capabilities of contemporary smart phones. Marakas et al. (1998) draw a distinction between generalized computer self-efficacy and technology- or task-specific computer self-efficacy. In order to maintain a psychometric control on our specific technology of choice, we developed scale items focused on a set of smart phone features that are readily recognized and understood by young adults in the general workforce. Furthermore, as recommended by Marakas et al. (2007), we avoid the reuse of previously published measures that are “problematic” for CSE involving technology domains that change over time. Instead, we sought contemporary concepts and phone features to make the construct relevant to the mobile phone domain that evolved rapidly in the prior decade. The authors engaged a small panel of students to identify common smart phone features. These features were reviewed for content by several IS researchers in order to ascertain whether they did indeed capture the construct of interest. Feature labels were generalized to remove technical and brand names and focus on the functional capability. For example, SMS texting, MMS texting, and instant messaging were combined in the survey instrument as a single general functional capability of “text messaging.” Fifteen items were included in an attempt to fully capture pertinent dimensions of CSE for smart phones. This scale was employed in a pilot study (N = 40) to establish face validity and verify the instrument was capturing the intended construct. Following this activity, the instrument was adjusted using the iterative model of Marakas et al. (2007). After final data collection, this formative scale was validated using an analytic approach proposed by Hair et al. (2011). During this iterative process, one item was removed for excessive multicollinearity with variance inflation factors greater than 5, and another removed for poor relative contribution revealed by insignificant outer weight (p-value > 0.05). Multiple iterations produced a set of 13 formative items as an effective measure of computer self-efficacy specific to this generation of smart phones. The final independent variable involves the objective characteristic of individual experience with their current smart phone. Mobile phones have undergone a large variety and fast rate of technology and capability change in the period leading up to this study (De Moor et al. 2010). We therefore view general domain familiarity to be less important than experience with the current smart phone. Our study furthermore focuses on work-related usage events where modern smart phones have become important mobile work support platforms (Yuan et al. 2010). Activity in the workplace setting follows a pattern of high intensity adaptation in the early months then decreases as routines and habits form. The dual influences of repeating cycles of new generations of mobile phones that require familiarity and knowledge acquisition to fully incorporate, along with the pressure of routinization, suggests that the amount of time with their current smart phone is a relevant measure of this individual user characteristic. Operationalizing this concept in a one dimensional measure is consistent with other work (Tyre and Orlikowski 1994) as we believe the construct is easily understood and evaluated by respondents in the context of a survey.\n",

            "The dependent variable in this study also represents a familiar construct and scale. Having chosen to collect data from users directly in a broad cross-sectional study, we concede that measuring actual work task performance is problematic. Individuals pursue performance objectives unique to their setting. Specific tasks that users pursue with their smart phones vary dramatically and absolute measures of performance are not directly comparable. It is the user’s perception and expectation of their performance with the technology that is relevant to their personal decisions to engage in adaptation behaviors that are largely voluntary and self-initiated. An appropriate proxy for performance in this context is the relative performance advantage that users perceive they create as they adapt the technology. To the extent that each user understands what they perceive to be expected outcomes, the self-reflective measure standardizes the construct in a manner that facilitates comparison across settings. We adapted the established “short scale” of relative advantage from Moore and Benbasat (1991). This approach has been used by other scholars studying task and technology (Belanger et al. 2001; Dishaw and Strong 1999; Goodhue and Thompson 1995).\n",
            "\n",
            "Process Variables\n",
            "While measures for independent and dependent variables were based on scales and approaches common in the IS literature, new scales were developed for the adaptation behaviors that are the central focus of this investigation. Likert scales have long been used to define and measure exploration and exploitation at the firm level (O’Reilly and Tushman 2013); however, we found no suitable existing scales for these constructs at the level of individuals that differentiated across the four behaviors associated with structuration episodes. Drawing upon the unique characteristics of each adaptation behavior delineated in the topology of adaptation behaviors, we constructed an exploratory survey with 5 items for I-TASK, 11 items for R-TASK, 7 items for I-TECH, and 7 items for R-TECH. The wording of questions draws upon key ideas from construct development. Exploitive technology adaptation captures ideas presented in the literature that align with the conceptualization developed for this study. Several concepts from existing literature inspired phrases and wording of these questions. Establishing the spirit, possibility, and structural potential of a technology is a prerequisite for interactions aligned with intended and standard appropriation behaviors (DeSanctis and Poole 1994; Markus and Silver 2008). The first act reflective of exploitive adaptation is learning and establishing knowledge of a technology’s intended spirit and standard functional affordances (Hsieh et al. 2011; Nambisan et al. 1999). This learning enables using more of the technology features (Wang and Hsieh 2006). Phrases such as “experimented with” draw on this concept. A second act is manipulation that alters functional affordances using intentionally provided configuration settings. Customization and personalization operate on designer provided configuration to alter functional affordances (Bhattacherjee and Harris 2009; Desouza et al. 2007). References to manipulating settings and preferences are reflective of this concept. A third action is manipulation that expands functional affordances while sustaining the spirit of technology in the context of expected use (Germonprez and Zigurs 2009; Markus and Silver 2008; Sun 2012). Questions that reference existing and available features maintain the scope for manipulations to an a priori spirit as understood by the user. Exploratory technology adaptation involves a disregard for the spirit of the technology and an instrumental purpose to create new functional affordances. Actions aimed at creating new capabilities that deviate from the spirit as delivered, cross into the territory of uncertain returns as they offer unique value that is substantially (Bygstad 2005) or qualitatively (DesAutels 2011) different. Phrases involving “deviation from standard,” “nonstandard,” and “unusual” establish a linkage to the exploratory instrumental purpose. In addition, phrases referencing “designing” and “modifying” reflect behaviors and creative intent that the user perceives to be inventive or for a novel purpose (Desouza et al. 2007). This construct extends to reinvention (Rice and Rogers 1980) whereby a user intentionally seeks to enable functional affordances that go beyond those delineated or encouraged by their provider (Jasperson et al. 2005). Phrases that capture a user tampering in a restricted or discouraged manner reflect on this concept. Exploitive task adaptation involves existing structure and work processes changed to incorporate a technology (Beaudry and Pisonneault 2005; Dennis et al. 2001). Phrases that emphasize actions to perform “existing tasks better” reflect the focal scope of this construct. Second level changes such as altering the speed or pace of tasks is also reflective of this construct (Malone and Rockart 1991). In addition, stopping certain task behaviors made obsolete by the new technology capture a reverse coded variant (Ward et al. 2008). Refinements made to this construct in the course of several pilot studies introduced the clarifying concept of intent by including phrases such as “try,” “attempt,” “strive,” and “doing my best.” This extends the construct to task adaptation behaviors irrespective of success within a single usage episode. Exploratory task adaptation involves using a technology to significantly transform tasks (Orlikowski 2000), or attempt new tasks previously considered beyond the spirit or scope of the technology (DeSanctis and Poole 1994; Ward et al. 2008). Phrases and terminology that emphasize “newness” or “previously not possible” before the user’s action, differentiate this construct from exploitive task adaptation. This construct extends to new coordination structures (Malone and Rockart 1991), such as those associated with new places and settings. As with exploitive task adaptation, a refinement developed in the course of pilot studies is the characteristic of intent. Words such as “try,” “strive,” and “attempt” extend the operationalization to exploratory behaviors irrespective of success.\n",

            "This survey was administered in a pilot study (N = 123 after removing responses without work-related tasks and excessive missing data) as input for a conventional exploratory factor analysis. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity both indicated factor analysis is appropriate. The principal component method was used to isolate distinct latent constructs. The technology measures converged as expected with I-TECH forming around five items loading between 0.56 and 0.90. R-TECH formed around six items loading between 0.60 and 0.90. Cronbach’s Alpha, composite reliability, and AVE measures all support stable measurement scales. However, items for the task constructs (I-TASK and R-TASK) converged on a single latent factor, suggesting that pilot respondents were not able to sufficiently distinguish the concepts of exploitive task adaptation and exploratory task adaptation. After consultation with a senior IS scholar, the task adaptation items were reworded to more carefully reflect the distinguishing concepts suggested by the topology. A second pilot survey was administered (N = 40) to test discriminant validity of the new scale involving six items for I-TASK and five items for R-TASK concurrent with the technology items that previously loaded above 0.60. Results of this pilot represented an improvement and, with minor changes, the final survey instrument was created involving the best four items for each task adaptation construct and the best three items for each technology adaptation construct. Technology adaptation items that had remained strong through all pilots were reduced to a minimize survey fatigue in order to secure a larger usable dataset with improved statistical power. The weakness of the initial task adaptation items suggested a weak theoretical conceptualization. In conjunction with maturing the test instrument, we revised the adaptation topology to more effectively distinguish change and innovation. The iterative scale development process paralleled the refinement and clarification of the topology of adaptation behaviors to capture the exploration and exploitation ideas suggested by structuration theory. This study converged on I-TECH items that emphasize manipulations involving exploitation of what are perceived to be existing features, preferences, and settings of a user’s smart phone. R-TECH items emphasize deviation from standard capabilities or attempting to enable previously discouraged capabilities that cross an imaginary boundary that is exploratory and potentially transformational. The revised I-TASK items emphasize existing work tasks to capture the exploitive nature of appropriations that reinforce and build upon status quo work process tasks. R-TASK items emphasize new and different tasks, their settings, and associated responsibilities that represent a shift away from status quo work processes toward appropriations that were previously not in scope.\n",

            "Establishing Validity of Adaptation Scales\n",
            "Because the adaptation scales are new and the distinction between each of the four dimensions of adaptation is central to our study, multiple analytic tests have been employed to evaluate the validity of our measures. While it is common for EFA analysis to use the “Kaiser rule” with a cutoff of eigenvalues at 1, this method has been demonstrated to be the least accurate1 and most variable of all methods (Lance et al. 2006). We instead follow a course that attempts to assure that the factors maintain theoretical coherence. Unidimensionality testing is done with a comparison of measurement models (Gefen et al. 2000) using an iterative approach across a range of factor models to identify the best-fitting alternative. To determine a starting point for incremental model comparisons, a principal component EFA using equimax rotation seeking 75 percent explained variation (Stevens 1996, p. 364) revealed four factors with acceptable convergence. Factor analysis loadings are above the commonly cited 0.40 minimum level (Gefen et al. 2000; Hair et al. 1998), with no off-factor items loading higher than a factor’s indicators (see the Four-Factor Model in Table C1). This combined with statistically significant outer item loadings in a confirmatory factor analysis (Table B1) provides further support for convergent validity (Gefen and Straub 2005). Subsequent rotations were forced for 2, 3, and 5 factor models for comparison of measures (item clusters shown in Table C1). We then examined incrementally each model using a chi-square difference test to reveal the best fitting pattern (Gefen et al. 2000). The chi-square difference method prefers the most parsimonious model (fewest factors and paths) that demonstrates statistical superiority. Each model with more factors represents a significant improvement over the adjacent less factor model, except the five- factor model which is not a significant improvement (Table C2). The task adaptation factors in particular have relatively high cross-factor correlation. A rigorous multistep assessment is presented to test the hypotheses that even where items are correlated across factors, they must be considered distinct. The first two steps employ the CFA method for a series of nested CFA-models (Bagozzi and Phillips 1982; Brooke et al. 1988). Unlike the subjective criteria of EFA, this method provides a hypothesis test of unidimensionality for a set of measures involving both correlated and uncorrelated latent variables (O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka 1998). These steps have been similarly used by other scholars to check discriminant validity of exploration and exploitation scales (Mom et al. 2009). A final step, the square-root of average variance extracted method (Fornell and Larcker 1981), has become increasingly popular for evaluating PLS-SEM measurement models (Ringle et al. 2012).\n",

As shown in Table C2, this is a comparison of model (a) with model (d) involving chi-square of 483.72, which is statistically significant (p < 0.01), providing evidence of discriminant validity. A comparison of the three- and four-factor models provides strong evidence (p < 0.001) that the factors with relatively high correlation are distinct. Multiple pairwise chi-square difference tests compare the chi-square statistic of an unconstrained CFA model (with all formative constructs freely correlated) with a constrained model (covariance between two constructs set equal to 1). A series of CFA tests were conducted involving the adaptation scales developed for this study (I-TASK, R-TASK, I-TECH, and R-TECH). As is evident in Table C3, null hypothesis of model equivalence is rejected in each case (p < 0.01), providing strong support for discriminant validity. The Fornell and Larcker (1981) method demonstrates that AVE is greater than the square of the constructs correlation to other factors (square root AVE > correlation to other constructs).

            "Our research model involved examination of the mediation effects that task adaptation behaviors have on technology adaptation behaviors. The theory advanced is that task adaptation is influenced by technology adaptation. While a longitudinal investigation can collect strong evidence of the precedence of events and behaviors, the broad cross-sectional single-point-in-time method used in this study is challenged to provide definitive sequencing. The question of sequencing is relevant. For example, an experimental study of groups using decision support systems demonstrated how organizations can employ configuration options within a technology to improve adherence to intended processes— in effect, the flexible aspects of a technology partially mediate task adaptation (Wheeler and Valacich 1996). This is an example of technology mediating task at a cross hierarchical level; technology adaptations managed by an organization-level administrator mediate task adaptations by a group. While this study does not address the situation in which both task and technology adaptations are in the hands of the same actors, it does raise the concern that many use cases are encompassed in any cross-sectional survey. We therefore pursue a statistical method to provide an indication that task adaptation follows technology adaptation in the form of the Hausman test of endogeneity.2 Evidence that technology adaptation variables are exogenous with regard to the task adaptation constructs suggests they are not dependent upon these other instrumental variables. Similarly, evidence that task adaptation variables are endogenous with regard to the technology adaptation constructs suggests they follow from these other instrumental variables. Weighted composites calculated during PLS analysis of the final survey were captured and used as latent variable scores for instrumental variable regression using the STATA package.

An initial CFA model involves latent variables PERF, I-TASK, R-TASK, I-TECH, R-TECH, and MARKER along with their associated items. The baseline CFA model constrains the correlations between MARKER and other variables to zero in order to establish baseline uncorrelated item loadings and error variances. The Method-C model adds method factor paths to each item in substantive latent variables while constraining these method paths to be constant across the model. This is done by adding item paths between the MARKER latent factor and all manifest variables. Each non-MARKER item loads on two latent factors, its theoretical construct and the marker construct, with the marker path constrained to a common value across the model. The chi-square difference between the baseline and Method-C models provides a hypothesis test that the marker variable exposes actual common method bias. In our data, this test supports the conclusion of statistically significant method effects (p = 0.001). The Method-U removes the constraint that method effects are common across the model and allows calculation of unique method effects for each manifest variable. The chi-square difference between Method-C and Method-U provides a hypothesis test that unique method effects is a superior characterization. In our data, this test is not significant (p = 0.111) supporting a conclusion that method effects are not unique for each measure and should be considered common.

While there are advantages of covariance based structural equation modeling (CBSEM), our situation contraindicates this method of analysis. The formative nature of CSE and the large number of paths led to the conclusion that this particular data set was too small for maximum likelihood estimation. Our sample size (N = 189) is less than the recommended five cases per estimated parameter necessary for reliable CBSEM (Bentler and Chou 1987). PLSSEM is more forgiving with a recommended sample size approximately 10 times larger than the number of items included in the most complex construct (Gefen et al. 2000). CSE represents the largest construct with 13 retained items, indicating a minimum sample size of 130. An alternate sample size criterion is 10 times the number of constructs (Chin et al. 2003). Including control variables, there are 13 first order factors in the full path model (when including common method variance marker and control variables), suggesting a minimum sample size of 130. The complexity of our model that includes multiple mediators also guided our selection of PLS-SEM. Recent comparisons support the performance of PLS-SEM in our sample size range, particularly with complex models (Goodhue et al. 2012; Reinartz et al. 2009). Based on these criteria and available data, we have chosen PLS as an appropriate tool for this analysis. A conventional “linear path” model is analyzed using PLS regression within WarpPLS 4.0 (Kock 2015) with bootstrap resampling to assess the outer measurement model. Item specific statistics are reported in Appendix B. A detailed examination of operationalized constructs and scales with additional validity tests is provided in Appendix C. During preprocessing missing values (less than 2% for any single measure in this dataset) were replaced with multiple regression imputation. The WarpPLS tool standardizes all data during preprocessing by subtracting the mean for a measure and dividing by the standard deviation. Using this method, standardized values for Likert scale measures are centered on zero and range from positive 4 to negative 4 (Kock 2015, p38). The inner path model and hypothesis tests were subsequently conducted in multiple stages. First a linear PLS regression using “PLS mode M” (path weighing scheme, MIMIC mode) (Kock 2015; Tenenhaus et al. 2005) with bootstrap resampling was used to calculate the linear relationship parameters for the full model. Statistics for hypothesis testing are reported in Table 1. Additional full model statistics are reported in Tables D1, D2, and D3.\n",

            "Supplementary Statistics: Mediation Testing\n",
            "Multiple approaches for mediation testing have been performed in the interest of robustness. Mediation analysis has long been dominated by the causal steps approach proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986). Recent advances in statistical methods provide means to quantify indirect effects (Hayes 2009). This is particularly valuable when the effects are simultaneous and build through a series of repeated events such as the case with ASTI. The test presented in the main text (see Table 2) is the bootstrap-t method (MacKinnon et al. 2004). This test uses bootstrap resampling to calculate path coefficients, standard errors, and effect sizes for the intervening effect of a mediator variable. While the boostrap-t method demonstrates good power for our sample size, we performed two additional tests for robustness (see Table D4). The “delta” method (Sobel 1982) was used to analyze the product-of-coefficients. This approach calculates the indirect effect as the product of two paths (a is the path from the independent variable to the intervening variable, and b is the path from the intervening variable to the dependent variable). Significance is derived as the ratio of the product to its standard error to calculate a test statistic and determine a p-value assuming a standard normal distribution. Despite its assumption of normal distribution, which does not hold for the product of two random variables (Bollen and Stine 1990), this method has been widely used with demonstrated relative bias of less than 5 percent for samples of the size available here (MacKinnon et al. 2007). A final approach that accounts for the asymmetric distribution of a product is performed using an empirical M-test. This method addresses the correlation between paths (the a and b point estimates) and the resulting non-normal distribution. The M-test establishes a confidence interval with high power and good Type I error control (MacKinnon et al. 2007; Tofighi and MacKinnon 2011). When the confidence interval does not include zero, the null hypothesis is rejected and interpreted as support for the proposed hypothesis. As noted in the main text, all three methods find statistically significant evidence of mediation for H4a, H4b, H5a, and H5b.\n",

            "A supplementary path analysis was performed to assess nonlinear relationships between constructs. This is necessary to draw conclusions for experience (EXP) where we hypothesized an inverted U relationship. An exploratory examination of nonlinear paths involving the adaptation constructs was also conducted. In this exploratory study, the path-model configuration in WarpPLS was set to Warp2 for paths from EXP to I-TECH and R-TECH to investigate the hypothesized quadratic relationship. In this model, the relationship between EXP and I-TECH was best characterized as linear, but remained nonsignificant (see Table 3). By contrast the relationship from EXP to R-TECH was revealed to be quadratic (p = 0.005). In the exploratory model, the paths from I-TECH, R-TECH, I-TASK and R-TASK to the dependent variable PERF were set to Warp3 in an attempt to expose quadratic and cubic relationships. I-TECH and R-TASK proved to be best characterized as linear. However, curvilinear relationships were revealed for R-TECH (p = 0.010) and I-TASK (p < 0.001). A subsequent multivariate regression analysis was performed to calculate both the linear and nonlinear coefficients and related statistics. The latent variable composite scores from PLS-SEM were imported into STATA to calculate statistics (see Table 4) using OLS regression. A further diagnostic analysis was conducted to calculate VIF scores (see Table D5) and expose potential collinearity among the constructs modeled in OLS. VIF remains below the threshold of 3.3, suggesting collinearity is not a concern.\n",

            "Abstract Prior research suggests that information technology (IT) project escalation can result from the deaf effect, a phenomenon in which decision makers fail to heed risk warnings communicated by others. Drawing inspiration from stewardship theory, we posited that when messengers carrying risk warnings about a project are seen as collaborative partners, decision makers are more likely to heed the message. Conversely, we theorized that when messengers are seen as opponents, decision makers are more likely to exhibit the deaf effect. We further posited that certain psychological factors (i.e., framing and perceived control) would moderate the effect of the messenger-recipient relationship on the deaf effect. To test these ideas, we conducted two experiments. When messengers were seen as collaborative partners, recipients assigned more relevance to the risk warning and perceived a higher risk, making them less willing to continue the project. Framing the outcomes associated with redirecting or continuing the project in terms of losses (rather than gains) weakened this effect. However, when recipients perceived a high degree of control over the project the effect was strengthened. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

            "In March 2013, an outside consulting ﬁrm issued warnings regarding the $600 million federal health insurance website project known as Healthcare.gov. Senior Obama administration ofﬁcials were briefed regarding the content of the consulting ﬁrm’s report. But the warnings were ignored and the Healthcare.gov website was rolled out as scheduled on October 1, 2014. This resulted in a ﬁasco in which millions of Americans tried to enroll in health care plans under the new Affordable Care Act but were unable to do so (Eilperin & Somashekhar, 2013). The very troubled launch of Healthcare.gov and the chaos that it created illustrates what can happen when people become overly committed to failing courses of action and ignore risk warnings. Unfortunately, this underlying failure pattern – escalation of commitment to a failing course of action – is an all-too-frequent and serious problem in information technology (IT) projects like the launch of Healthcare.gov (Keil et al, 2000a).\n",

            "Prior research on escalation has tended to focus on the psychological factors that encourage individuals to continue pursuing a previously chosen course of action despite negative feedback, such as personal responsibility (Staw, 1976), sunk cost (Arkes & Blumer, 1985; Garland, 1990), and project completion level (Conlon & Garland, 1993; Keil et al, 1995b; Moon, 2001). Some studies, however, have suggested that IT project escalation can also be caused by the so-called ‘deaf effect’ (Keil & Robey, 2001; Cuellar, 2009), which refers to a communication failure in which decision makers exhibit resistance to or fail to heed risk warnings communicated by subordinates or other individuals who play the role of bad news messengers. Keil et al (2014) suggest that executives often turn a deaf ear to IT project status reports. This phenomenon may be particularly salient in IT projects which often involve power and politics that invariably shape how one chooses to respond to problems and the repercussions that will result (Markus, 1983; Sillince & Mouakket, 1997). Prior work on the deaf effect is somewhat limited, and has been grounded in concepts from social psychology (Chaiken, 1980), communication (Rakow, 1986), and IT project escalation (Keil & Robey, 1999; Cuellar et al, 2006). In deaf effect situations, messengers deliver risk warnings to decision makers who must decide whether to ascribe relevance to these messages and ultimately whether or not to heed the warning or continue the project as planned. The inﬂuence of the messenger-recipient relationship (MRR) on the deaf effect represents a key theoretical gap in our understanding of this phenomenon. In this paper, we draw inspiration from stewardship theory, positing that when messengers carrying risk warnings about a project are seen as collaborative partners (i.e., working on the same side toward the same goal), decision makers will be more likely to listen and respond appropriately to the message. Conversely, when messengers carrying risk warnings about a project are seen as opponents (i.e., working in opposition and not being viewed as being on the same side), decision makers will more likely turn a deaf ear to the message. Speciﬁcally, we address two important theoretical gaps concerning the deaf effect and escalation of commitment: (1) the impact of MRR, as informed by stewardship theory, on whether the decision maker turns a deaf ear to risk warnings (i.e., deaf effect), and (2) the moderating effect of two key psychological factors that are associated with escalation behavior (i.e., gain/loss framing and perceived control) on the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect. Our aim is to answer the following three research questions: (1) Are recipients less likely to exhibit the deaf effect when a risk warning comes from a messenger who is viewed as a collaborative partner rather than an opponent? (2) What are the mediating mechanisms through which the MRR inﬂuences the deaf effect? (3) How is the effect of the MRR on the deaf effect moderated by key psychological factors that have been associated with escalation (e.g., framing and perceived control)?\n",
            "\n",
            "To address these questions, we conducted two scenariobased experiments in which we manipulated the MRR (collaborative partner vs opponent) to determine if decision makers are less likely to exhibit the deaf effect when a risk warning comes from a messenger who is viewed as a collaborative partner rather than an opponent. In the ﬁrst experiment, we further manipulated the framing of the outcomes associated with redirecting or continuing the project in gain/loss terms to investigate its role as a moderator of the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect. In the second experiment, we manipulated perceived control to investigate its role as a moderator of the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: ﬁrst, we discuss the theoretical background for our study, justify our hypotheses, and present our research model. Next, we describe the experiment and present the results that were obtained. Finally, we discuss the implications of our study both for research and practice.\n",

            "While negative feedback is inherently part of an escalation situation, prior research has paid relatively little attention as to where this negative feedback generally comes from or the manner in which it is delivered.\n",
            "\n",
            "The deaf effect as a cause of escalation In the context of IT project escalation, the negative feedback often comes in the form of a risk warning delivered by another member of the organization to the decision maker. Thus, the deaf effect perspective on escalation highlights the notion that there are often risk warnings associated with escalation situations (as in the case of the Healthcare.gov example given above) and that escalation can occur when decision makers choose to ignore these risk warnings. Here, we posit that whether such warnings are heeded or ignored hinges on the MRR. To date, there has been very little research on the deaf effect in the context of IT project escalation. On the basis of interviews with internal auditors, Keil & Robey (2001) ﬁrst described the deaf effect as a failure to respond to messages of an impending IT project failure. Some of the auditors recalled instances in which they had issued risk warnings about projects only to ﬁnd that their concerns were ignored by senior management. Subsequent research in this area has been very limited and has focused on the inﬂuence of messenger characteristics (e.g., credibility and role prescription) on the deaf effect. For example, Cuellar et al (2006) conducted an experiment in which they found that the credibility of the messenger inﬂuenced both the perceived message relevance and the degree to which the decision maker chose to heed the risk warning, as evidenced by their willingness to continue a previously chosen course of action. In an extension of Cuellar et al (2006), Lee et al (2014) found that the role prescription of the messenger also inﬂuenced perceived message relevance, thereby shaping\n",

            "the extent to which the decision maker heeds the messenger’s risk warning. Speciﬁcally, decision makers were more likely to heed risk warnings that came from individuals who were role prescribed to issue such warnings (e.g., internal auditors) as opposed to individuals who were not and this relationship was mediated by perceived message relevance. Lee et al (2014) also found that risk perception mediates the relationship between messenger credibility and willingness to continue a troubled IT project. While the above studies point to the importance of certain messenger characteristics (e.g., credibility and role prescription), they do not explore the nature of the MRR and how this inﬂuences the deaf effect. This represents an important gap in our understanding. Many organizations employ internal auditors who are role prescribed to provide credible risk warnings on large IT projects should such warnings be required. While prior work focused on credibility and role prescription of the messenger, in this study, we focus on situations involving internal auditors who are assumed to be both role prescribed and credible. Therefore, our focus is not on messenger characteristics, but rather on the MRR.\n",

            "than an opponent. Consistent with Kasima et al (2011), we posit that internal auditors can follow either an agency theory perspective or a stewardship theory perspective depending upon the role they wish to play. Thus, we distinguish a MRR in which the messenger is seen as a collaborative partner (stewardship theory) from one in which the messenger is regarded as an opponent (agency theory). In order to address our ﬁrst two research questions, namely whether recipients are less likely to exhibit the deaf effect when a risk warning comes from a messenger who is viewed as a collaborative partner rather than an opponent (RQ1), and what potential mediating mechanisms govern this relationship (RQ2), we offer the following theorizing and hypotheses (H1 and H2) concerning the effect of MRR on the deaf effect and mediating role of both message relevance and perceived risk in this relationship.\n",
            "\n",
            "Stewardship theory and the MRR Drawing inspiration from the corporate governance literature, we suggest that internal auditors can follow different approaches in carrying out their work. In the past, auditors have often positioned themselves or been seen as ‘the enemy’ because of their emphasis on a monitoring and control-oriented approach to their work. Such an approach, which is consistent with an agency theory ( Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Fama, 1980; Fama & Jensen, 1983) view of the world (i.e., that agents will not act in the interest of the principal and must therefore be closely monitored and disciplined) is not trust-based and ultimately tends to create an adversarial MRR. Under the agency theory view of governance, those who work on IT projects cannot be trusted to reveal the true status of the project and to manage it in a way that takes the best interests of the organization into account. Therefore, auditors must closely monitor such projects and the personnel who work on them. Thus, under the agency theory approach to project governance, project personnel are apt to regard the auditor (or messenger) as an ‘opponent’ who is not to be trusted. In contrast, stewardship theory represents an alternative view of governance (see, for example, Sundaramurthy & Lewis (2003) for a comparison of stewardship theory and agency theory) that emphasizes a more collaborative approach. Under stewardship theory, the auditor’s role would be to service and advise (as opposed to discipline and monitor per agency theory). We believe that stewardship theory (Davis et al, 1997) therefore offers an alternative approach to IT project governance; one that is more trust-based. Thus, under the stewardship theory approach to project governance, project personnel are apt to regard the auditor (or messenger) as a collaborative partner rather\n",
            "\n",
            "Effect of MRR on the deaf effect through message relevance Prior work by Keil & Robey (2001), involving interviews with auditors, suggests that the relationship between auditor and decision maker may inﬂuence the deaf effect in escalation situations. For example, one interviewee suggested that an auditor is likely to have more inﬂuence if s/he is perceived as a ‘team player’ instead of a ‘policeman’ as illustrated in the following remark:\n",
            "I think the way we handled it made a difference . . . I think just the way we came about it, as a team player instead of a policeman . . . Even though we are an independent appraisal organization, we are still part of the same corporate team, and our goals are their goals basically. We all want the company to do well. (Keil & Robey, 2001). Thus, we have some anecdotal evidence that a collaborative relationship may minimize the deaf effect. Conversely, in a study of internal auditing, Chambers et al (1988) found that ‘the auditee’s reaction to the inspection style of auditing was hostile. The auditee was inclined not to listen to the auditor or to beneﬁt from the ﬁndings’ (Chambers et al, 1988, p. 73). On the basis of stewardship theory, we posit that when an auditor is seen as a collaborative partner, decision makers will be less likely to turn a deaf ear to risk warnings issued by the auditor. The underlying logic for this assertion is that decision makers are more likely to be responsive to risk warnings when the messenger has the clear goal to contribute to management performance instead of exposing management failures. Moreover, when an auditor is seen as a collaborative partner, we theorize that MRR’s inﬂuence on the deaf effect is mediated by message relevance. Message relevance as a proposed mediator is consistent with the Evans’ heuristic-analytic theory which posits that human information processing consists of two stages: heuristic processing and analytic processing (Evans, 1996, 2006). According to this model, in the heuristic processing\n",

Lee et al (2014) found that message relevance served to mediate the relationship between certain messenger characteristics (i.e., the messenger’s role prescription and credibility) and the deaf effect. In our research, we posit that message relevance will mediate the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect. The logic for this assertion is that people will assign more relevance to a message when it comes from a collaborative partner who is trusted and shares the decision maker’s goals, rather than from an opponent. When more relevance is assigned to a risk warning, the decision maker will be less likely to exhibit the deaf effect. Therefore, we propose the following mediation hypothesis: H1: When an auditor is seen as a collaborative partner rather than an opponent, decision makers are less likely to turn a deaf ear to the auditor’s risk warning and this effect will be mediated by message relevance.\n",
            "\n",
            "this relationship holds across cultures in escalation situations (Keil et al, 2000b, c). Moreover, there is one prior study on the deaf effect in which risk perception has actually been shown to mediate the relationship between the credibility of a messenger and escalation (Lee et al, 2014). Therefore, we propose the following mediation hypothesis: H2: When an auditor is seen as a collaborative partner rather than an opponent, decision makers are less likely to turn a deaf ear to the auditor’s risk warning and this effect will be mediated by perceived risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "Effect of MRR on deaf effect through perceived risk As theorized earlier, the MRR will inﬂuence the deaf effect. Speciﬁcally, when an auditor is seen as a collaborative partner, decision makers will be less likely to turn a deaf ear to risk warnings issued by the auditor. Furthermore, we theorize that MRR’s inﬂuence on the deaf effect is mediated by perceived risk. Perceived risk refers to a ‘decision maker’s assessment of the risk inherent in a situation’ (Sitkin & Pablo, 1992, p. 12). In this research, we propose that when an auditor is perceived as a collaborative partner and issues a risk warning, the decision maker’s perceived risk associated with the project will be greater than when the risk warning is issued by an auditor who is seen as an opponent. The underlying logic for this assertion is that decision makers will tend to discount the reported level of risk in a project when a messenger who is regarded as an opponent issues a risk warning that characterizes the project as having a certain level of risk. This tendency to discount is based on the fact that a messenger who is seen as an opponent will be regarded as having a motivation to expose management failures, and thus the level of risk ascribed to a project by such a messenger will be perceived as being exaggerated by the recipient. Conversely, we theorize that the reported level of risk in a project will not be discounted when the message comes from a collaborative partner who is perceived to have the same goals and therefore is regarded as being ‘on the same side’. We further theorize that perceived risk inﬂuences the deaf effect. Prior research has shown that perceived risk inﬂuences risk decisions (Slovic et al, 1982; Sitkin & Pablo, 1992; Sitkin & Weingart, 1995). Speciﬁcally, greater perceived risk has been shown to reduce risky decisionmaking behavior (Sitkin & Weingart, 1995). Prior studies have also shown a signiﬁcant negative relationship between risk perception and the decision to continue a software development project (Keil et al, 2000c) and that\n",

            "Davis et al (1997) call for further research on the inﬂuence of psychological variables on stewardship mechanisms, suggesting to us that it may be fruitful to examine the moderating role of certain psychological factors on the MRR. Two key psychological factors that are associated with escalation of commitment and may interact with the collaborative partnering approach prescribed by stewardship theory are gain/loss framing and perceived control. In order to address our third research question, namely how the effect of the MRR on the deaf effect is moderated by key psychological factors that have been associated with escalation (RQ3), we offer the following theorizing and hypotheses (H3a and H3b) concerning the moderating role of gain/loss framing and perceived control.\n",

            "Gain/Loss framing as a moderator of the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect Prospect theory suggests that decisions can be inﬂuenced by the way in which they are framed. On the basis of prospect theory, individuals are risk-seeking when a decision is framed as a choice between losses, but are risk averse when a decision is framed as a choice between gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Gain/loss framing refers to the presentation of outcomes as positive or negative deviations (gains or losses) from a neutral reference point, which is assigned a value of 0 (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). One of the classic examples of framing involves the possibility of a disease outbreak that will kill 600 people (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). When people are confronted with two alternative programs to combat the disease they tend to choose the program that will save 200 people over the program that confers a 1/3 probability of saving 600 people and a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved. However, when the two programs are framed differently, people tend to choose the program that will confers a 1/3 probability that nobody will die and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die over the program that will result in 400 people dying. Thus, even though the two choice problems are identical in terms of expected outcomes, when the choices involve gain framing, people demonstrate risk aversion (i.e., preferring the sure thing over the gamble); however, when the choices involve loss framing, people demonstrate risk seeking (i.e., preferring the gamble over the sure thing).\n",

            "Gain/loss framing is relevant to the ﬁeld of project escalation since it inﬂuences the risk preference of decision makers with regard to a project. Speciﬁcally, a loss framing has been associated with risk-seeking behavior which can engender escalation of commitment to a failing project (Rutledge & Harrell, 1993; Sharp & Salter, 1997) and the so-called sunk cost effect (Arkes & Blumer, 1985; Whyte, 1986; Garland, 1990). In escalation situations, decision makers may have a tendency to add further resources to a troubled project because the costs already incurred are perceived as losses, thereby invoking a loss framing. Numerous studies have invoked prospect theory and framing and to explain escalation, but the effect of gain/ loss framing on the strength of the relationship between MRR and escalation remains unknown. In escalation situations involving the deaf effect, we posit that gain/loss framing of the outcomes associated with redirecting or continuing the project will have an inﬂuence on the decision maker’s willingness to listen to the risk warning. Speciﬁcally, when an individual is placed in a loss frame, s/he may feel less compelled to listen to a risk warning. Our interest in this research, however, centers not on the main effect of gain/loss framing, but on how it interacts with the MRR. Speciﬁcally, we theorize that gain/loss framing of the project outcomes moderates the inﬂuence of MRR on the deaf effect. The underlying logic for this assertion is that when a decision maker is placed in a loss frame s/he will be less sensitive to the collaborative nature of the MRR. One explanation for this is that the loss frame makes the decision maker more riskseeking, and thus more resistant to risk warnings issued from either a collaborative partner or an opponent, thus weakening the impact of MRR differences on the deaf effect. Thus we state the following hypothesis: H3a: The gain/loss framing of the outcomes associated with redirecting or continuing the project moderates the inﬂuence of MRR on the deaf effect. Speciﬁcally, the inﬂuence of MRR on the deaf effect is weakened when the outcomes are framed as losses.\n",

            "context of the MRR. Therefore, the effect of perceived control on the strength of the relationship between MRR and escalation remains unknown. Perceived control provides decision makers with a sense that they can inﬂuence events in ways that mitigate risks. Consistent with Du et al (2007), we deﬁne perceived control as an individual’s own judgment of the extent to which s/he can control a project outcome, which should be distinguished from the actual level of control that an individual has (Thompson et al, 1998, p. 154). Prior research has shown that perceived control inﬂuences escalation decisions (Du et al, 2007; Jani, 2008). Speciﬁcally, a high level of perceived control is associated with risk-seeking behavior (i.e., escalation of commitment). In escalation situations involving the deaf effect, we posit that the decision maker’s perceived control over the project will have an inﬂuence on his/her willingness to listen to the risk warning. To the extent that an individual has high perceived control over a project, s/he may feel less compelled to listen to a risk warning. Our interest in this research, however, centers not on the main effect of perceived control, but on how it interacts with the MRR. Speciﬁcally, we theorize that perceived control moderates the inﬂuence of MRR on the deaf effect. The underlying logic for this assertion is that a messenger who exposes management failures and is therefore regarded as an opponent will likely trigger competitive arousal among decision makers who have a high level of perceived control over the project. Competitive arousal (Ku et al, 2005) coupled with high perceived control will encourage decision makers to exhibit the deaf effect. Conversely, decision makers with a low level of perceived control may feel less challenged to compete with a messenger who is viewed as an opponent. To summarize, decision makers with a high perceived control over the project will be more sensitive to differences in the MRR and therefore we expect the effect of MRR on the deaf effect will be stronger under the condition of high perceived control. Thus we state the following hypothesis: H3b: The decision maker’s perceived control over the project moderates the inﬂuence of MRR on the deaf effect. Speciﬁcally, the inﬂuence of MRR on the deaf effect is strengthened when perceived control over the project is high. In order to test our hypotheses, we conducted two experiments as explained in the methods section below. We opted for two separate experiments rather than one to keep the complexity at a manageable level and to maximize our degree of control. The research models for the two experiments are shown in Figures 1 and 2. As indicated in the ﬁgures, the mediation paths hypothesized in H1 and H2 are included in both models, the hypothesized moderating effect of gain/loss framing (H3a) is shown in Figure 1, and the hypothesized moderating effect of perceived control (H3b) is shown in Figure 2.\n",

            "Perceived control as a moderator of the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect Another factor that may inﬂuence how a decision maker responds to a messenger’s risk warnings is the decision maker’s perceived level of control over the project outcome. In our review of relevant literature, we identiﬁed only one previous study that has investigated the relationship between perceived control and escalation (Du et al, 2007). In a role-playing experiment, Du et al (2007) found that a higher degree of perceived control was associated with a lower level of risk perception and more risk seeking behavior (i.e., a greater tendency to escalate). However, it is important to note that the primary focus of the Du et al (2007) study was on the impact of attention-shaping tools on risk assessment. Thus, while they also examined escalation decision-making, they did not do so within the\n",

            "In addition to the hypothesized mediation paths and interactions shown in Figures 1 and 2, we have included additional paths in our models based on prior research as well as the need to include lower-order terms in order to test interactions. For example, the relationship between perceived control and perceived risk is well understood (Du et al, 2007), as is the relationship between gain/loss framing and perceived risk (Sitkin & Weingart, 1995). Therefore, we included these paths in our models but do not hypothesize them. Further, we include the paths from gain/loss frame (Figure 1) and perceived control (Figure 2) to escalation so that we may test the hypothesized moderation effects, but since these relationships are well established in literature we do not state formal hypotheses for them (Rutledge & Harrell, 1993; Sharp & Salter, 1997; Du et al, 2007). Finally, for the sake of completeness we include the paths from gain/loss frame to message relevance (Figure 1) and from perceived control to message relevance (Figure 2). While these relationships have not been previously tested, they lie outside our area of theoretical focus and therefore we do not state formal hypotheses for them. In our models, we control for the effects of gender, work experience, and risk propensity. Prior research has shown that both gender and work experience can inﬂuence the deaf effect (Cuellar et al, 2006). Risk propensity refers to a personality trait to seek or avoid risks (Sitkin & Pablo, 1992; Sitkin & Weingart, 1995). Lee et al (2014) found that risk propensity can inﬂuence the deaf effect. Thus, we include these three variables in order to control for their effects.\n",

To create the messenger-recipient context required to study the deaf effect, we adapted the approach used by Cuellar et al (2006). Our treatment for gain/loss framing in Experiment 1 was patterned after Wong et al (2008), and our treatment for perceived control in Experiment 2 was patterned after Du et al (2007). We asked the participants to consider themselves to be the project owner of a strategic IS-project within an insurance company. In accordance with the company’s standard procedures, the internal audit department assessed the quality of the testing activities just before implementation of the new IS. On the basis of this assessment, the internal auditor reported serious weaknesses in the testing activities designed to assess the reliability of critical data exchange with other IS. He estimates there is a 2/3 probability that exchange of data would show reliability problems in the ﬁrst month of operations. As a consequence, he reports that the project should be redirected and should not be continued as planned. The MRR was manipulated by portraying the internal auditor as either a collaborative partner or an opponent. For the collaborative partner manipulation, we drew on stewardship theory (Davis et al, 1997; Sundaramurthy & Lewis, 2003), describing the MRR as one that involved a high level of trust (Davis et al, 1997) and where the auditor has a history of contributing to management performance (Davis et al, 1997; Kasima et al, 2011). For the opponent manipulation, we described the MRR as one that involved a low level of trust (Davis et al, 1997) and where the auditor is seen as a ‘policeman’ (Chambers et al, 1988;\n",

            "Measurement model assessment We chose Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis to test our research models. PLS allows us to assess both the measurement model and structural model together (Gefen et al, 2000; Gefen et al, 2011). PLS is appropriate for testing theories in the early stages of development and allows us to test both mediation and moderation in the context of the model as a whole. In this study we used SmartPLS (Ringle et al, 2005) version 2.0. Before testing our structural model, we followed the recommended steps to establish the validity of our measurement model through tests of convergent and discriminant validity as described by Chin (1998) and Fornell & Larcker (1981).\n",
            "\n",
            "Convergent validity Two different assessments were made for convergent validity: (1) individual item reliability, and (2) construct reliability. Individual item reliability was assessed by examining the item-to-construct loadings for each construct that was measured with multiple indicators. In order for the shared variance between each item and its associated construct to exceed the error variance, the standardized loadings should be greater than 0.70.\n",
            "\n",
            "As seen in Table 3, all of our loadings exceeded this threshold across Experiments 1 and 2. We also considered the construct reliability for each block of measures, as shown in Table 4. Composite reliability scores and Cronbach’s α scores both measure the internal consistency among a given construct’s items. Unlike the more traditional Cronbach’s α, the composite reliability score does not assume that all indicators are equally weighted. Therefore, α tends to be a lower bound estimate of reliability (Chin, 1998). Bearden et al (1993) claim that a score of 0.7 indicates extensive evidence of reliability. Table 4 shows that the reliability for each of our constructs exceeds this threshold for both experiments. Fornell & Larcker (1981) view Average Variance Extracted (AVE) as a measure of construct reliability. The guideline threshold for AVE is 0.5, which means that 50% or more of variance of the indicators is accounted for (Chin, 1998). As Table 4 indicates, all of the constructs in our measurement model exceeded the established criterion for AVE.\n",

            "Discriminant validity We conducted two tests for discriminant validity. First, we calculated each indicator’s loading on its own construct as well as its cross-loading on all other constructs. Moving across the columns of Table 5, we see that each indicator loads higher on its own construct (in bold) than it does on any other constructs. Moreover, going down the rows of Table 5, we see that the indicators for a given construct have a higher loading with their own construct than do the indicators associated with any other construct. This provides good evidence of discriminant validity (Chin, 1998). As a second test of discriminant validity, we considered whether the AVEs of the latent constructs were greater than the square of the correlations among the latent constructs. When this is true, more variance is shared between the latent construct and its block of indicators than with another construct (Chin, 1998). As can be seen by reading across the rows of Table 6, our measures passed this test, thus providing additional evidence of discriminant validity. Structural model assessment With adequate measurement models in place for the two experiments, we tested our hypotheses by examining the structural models. The explanatory power of a structural model can be evaluated by looking at the R2 value in the ﬁnal dependent construct. As presented in Figures 3a and 3b, the explanatory power of our structural models is satisfactory with R2 for the ﬁnal dependent construct Continue of 0.521 in Experiment 1 and 0.463 in Experiment 2. After computing path estimates for the structural models, we used bootstrapping to obtain the corresponding t-values. With signiﬁcance levels of 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, the acceptable t-values for a one-tailed test would be 1.645, 2.326, and 3.091, respectively (appropriate given the directional nature of the hypotheses). Path coefﬁcients and t-values for the two models are presented in Figures 3a and 3b. Testing of mediation hypotheses As shown in Figures 3a and 3b, the MRR-to-message relevance and message relevance-to-continue paths are signiﬁcant in both experiments, as are the MRR-to-perceived risk and the perceived risk-to-continue paths. In Table 7 we present the results of our mediation analysis associated with these paths as hypothesized in H1 and H2 using PLS. In order to test\n",
            "\n",
            "these mediation hypotheses, we used the parameter estimates from the bootstrapping procedure in PLS, and calculated the standard error of each mediation effect. We then calculated a t-statistic for each mediation effect by dividing the magnitude of the mediation effect (i.e., the observed mediation effect from the original sample) by the standard error of the mediation effects. Probing indirect effects in this manner (i.e., using bootstrapping) is advantageous relative to the more traditional Sobel test approach because it does not impose any distributional assumptions regarding the indirect effect. Moreover, conducting the mediation analysis based on the PLS bootstrapping results has an advantage over the Shrout & Bolger (2002) regression based bootstrapping approach because it allows for testing of mediation effects within the context of the entire structural model (see, for example, Rai & Hornyak, 2013) as opposed to isolating one portion of the model at a time and running a series of mediation tests. Following this approach, we obtained signiﬁcant t-values for all of the hypothesized mediation effects as shown in Table 7. As a robustness check, we also conducted bootstrapping-based regressions following the Shrout & Bolger (2002) approach, using the Preacher & Hayes (2008) SPSS macro for multiple mediator models developed by Hayes. Results were consistent with those obtained through PLS. Taken as a whole, our results provide strong support for H1 and H2, as the hypothesized mediation paths were signiﬁcant across both experiments. As suggested by Preacher & Kelley (2011), we considered not only the statistical signiﬁcance of indirect effects but also their effect sizes. Following the presentation guidelines provided by Iacobucci (2008), we show in Table 7 the speciﬁc indirect effects via MsgRelev and PercRisk, in the context of the PLS-estimated direct effect and the total effect of MRR on Continue, for both our experiments. These speciﬁc indirect effects were calculated as the product of the two unstandardized paths from MRR to mediator and from mediator to Continue consistent with Preacher & Hayes (2008). Furthermore, as suggested by Iacobucci (2008) we present the ratio of the speciﬁc indirect effects to the total effect and the ratio of the direct effect to the total effect, across both our experiments.\n",

            "Interaction plots Figures 4a and 4b provide a visual display of the two interaction effects. To construct these ﬁgures, we used the mean values associated with each treatment condition and a composite score for the dependent variable. Figure 4a shows that decision makers in a loss frame are more likely to continue the project and thus exhibit the deaf effect to a risk warning. As expected, the line in the loss domain is ﬂatter than the line in the gain domain. Thus, when project outcomes are framed in terms of losses, people are less inﬂuenced by the MRR than when project outcomes are framed in terms of gains. Figure 4b shows that decision makers who have a high level of perceived control over the project are more likely to continue the project and thus exhibit the deaf effect to a risk warning. As expected, the line in the high control domain is steeper than the line in the low control domain. Thus, when perceived control is high, people are more inﬂuenced by the MRR than when perceived control is low.\n",

            "has paid relatively little attention as to where this negative feedback generally comes from or the manner in which it is delivered. In many instances, the negative feedback concerning a project and its status comes in the form of a risk warning delivered by another member of the organization to the decision maker. In our study we posited that whether such warnings are heeded or ignored hinges on the MRR, as informed by stewardship theory. Before discussing the implications of our study for research and practice, it is appropriate to consider limitations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Limitations While the experimental approach allowed us to achieve high internal validity, it obviously does not allow us to model all of the complexities of actual work settings. As is the case with all experiments, one must therefore be cautious in generalizing the results. To achieve the high level of internal validity afforded by laboratory experiments requires that researchers focus on a very small number of variables while tightly controlling possible confounding factors. By necessity, this means that it is neither practical nor desirable to attempt the level of realism normally associated with a workplace setting. This trade-off of higher internal validity for lower external validity is normal in laboratory experiments and should not necessarily be construed as a weakness. Experimental designs must therefore be evaluated not on the extent to which they reﬂect actual organizational settings, but rather on whether they contribute to our understanding of human decision-making (Dobbins et al, 1988). In our experiment we engaged university students in a decision task concerning an IT project. The use of student subjects is sometimes criticized because such subjects may lack the domain-speciﬁc knowledge needed to properly engage with the stimulus material. In our case, however, we relied not on undergraduate students with little or no work experience, but instead recruited masters’ students and executives with signiﬁcant work experience who were enrolled in a part-time professional program. Thus, we have every reason to believe that our participants were able to project themselves into the scenarios that formed the basis for our experiments. Moreover, since our goal was to generalize to theory and not to a particular population, the use of student subjects for our experiment was justiﬁed. Finally, as is customary in experiments of this type, we used self-reported measures. It is possible that self-reported measures for such constructs as message relevance might not show entirely consistent results with more objective measures (e.g., eye movement tracking). In spite of the aforementioned limitations, we believe that our results have implications for both research and practice. Implications for research Our study breaks new ground by addressing two theoretical gaps in the literature concerning the deaf effect and escalation of commitment: (1) the impact of MRR (collaborative partner vs opponent) on whether the decision\n",
            "\n",
            "maker turns a deaf ear to risk warnings, and (2) the moderating effect of two key psychological factors that are associated with escalation behavior (i.e., gain/loss framing and perceived control) on the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect. On the basis of two experiments that were inspired by the distinction between stewardship theory and agency theory views of project governance, involving 199 masters’ students and 134 executive students, respectively, we found empirical support for the impact of MRR (collaborative partner vs opponent) on the deaf effect, thus addressing the ﬁrst theoretical gap mentioned above. More speciﬁcally, we found that decision makers are less likely to turn a deaf ear to risk warnings, when the messenger is seen as a collaborative partner and that this effect is mediated by both message relevance (H1) and perceived risk (H2). In other words, our results provide empirical support for two mediating mechanisms between MRR and the deaf effect. First, people are less likely to turn a deaf ear to risk warnings when the messenger is seen as a collaborative partner, because they assign more relevance to a message when it comes from a collaborative partner (H1). These results are consistent with heuristic-analytic theory (Evans, 1996, 2006) and the notion that people ﬁlter the information to which they are exposed and assign relevance to particular aspects. Second, people are less likely to turn a deaf ear to risk warnings when the messenger is seen as a collaborative partner, because such messages will heighten their risk perception (H2). Conversely, when the messenger is seen as an opponent, people will tend to discount the reported level of risk in a project, thus leading to a lowering of risk perception. Such discounting is not likely to occur when the risk warning is issued by a messenger who is perceived as a collaborative partner with the same goals and who is therefore regarded as being ‘on the same side’. Our results for H1 and H2 contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the deaf effect as it relates to IT project escalation. While previous work (Cuellar et al, 2006; Lee et al, 2014) had pointed to the importance of certain messenger characteristics, our research adds to what was previously known by highlighting both the importance of the MRR and the mechanisms through which it inﬂuences the deaf effect. With regard to the second theoretical gap, our results provide empirical support for the moderating role of gain/ loss framing of project outcomes on the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect. More speciﬁcally, the inﬂuence of MRR on the deaf effect is weakened when the outcomes are framed as losses (H3a). Our results support the notion that when a decision maker is placed in a loss frame s/he will be less sensitive to the collaborative nature of the MRR. One explanation for this is that the loss frame makes the decision maker more risk-seeking, and thus more resistant to risk warnings issued from either a collaborative partner or an opponent, thus weakening the impact of MRR differences on the deaf effect. Further, our results provide empirical support for the moderating role of the decision maker’s perceived control\n",

            "on the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect. Speciﬁcally, the inﬂuence of MRR on the deaf effect is strengthened when perceived control over the project is high (H3b). Our results support the notion that a decision maker who perceives a high level of control over a project will be more sensitive to the collaborative nature of the MRR and therefore less likely to listen to a risk warning when the messenger is seen as an opponent. One explanation for this may be that a messenger who is regarded as an opponent will likely trigger competitive arousal among decision makers who have a high level of perceived control over the project. Taken together, our results for H3a and H3b contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the deaf effect as it relates to IT project escalation. While previous work has pointed to the role that certain psychological factors such as gain/loss framing and perceived control can have on escalation of commitment (see, for example, Rutledge & Harrell, 1993; Du et al, 2007), our research adds to what was previously known by highlighting the important moderating role that these factors can have on the relationship between MRR and the deaf effect.\n",

            "Directions for future research Several directions for future research emerge from our study. First, it would be useful to investigate the MRR in an actual organizational setting to conﬁrm the ﬁndings that were obtained in our experiments. Second, it would be insightful to conduct a longitudinal study that allowed us better understand the dynamics of the MRR and the role that history and particular events play in this evolution. Third, it might be beneﬁcial to consider not only relationships between individuals at an abstract level, but also within the context of the teams, departments, and organizations to which they belong. While this would require a multi-level approach, and some additional complexity, the rewards could be substantial. Thus, while our study sheds light on the deaf effect, we believe that it also opens up promising avenues for future research and we encourage others to advance our understanding of this important phenomenon. Implications for practice In addition to the research implications mentioned above, the results of our study have important implications for practice. First, on the basis of not one, but two experiments, we provide clear evidence that when an auditor who provides risk warnings is seen as a collaborative partner (rather than an opponent), this can greatly reduce the deaf effect. Our ﬁrst experiment involved Masters’ students, and our second experiment involved executives who were enrolled in a part-time professional degree program. The fact that we obtained consistent results with both Masters’ students and executives adds to the robustness of our ﬁndings. One key implication for practice that emerges from our study is that auditors’ messages will have more impact when the auditors are perceived as\n",
            "\n",
            "collaborative partners rather than as opponents. This is due to the fact that recipients ascribe greater relevance and perceive greater risk when the auditor is viewed as a collaborative partner (as opposed to an opponent). Therefore, managers should do everything in their power to create an environment in which auditors are viewed as collaborators, as this will help to ensure that their risk warnings are not ignored. Second, our research shows that when an auditor frames possible project outcomes as a choice between losses, this weakens the effect of being seen as a collaborative partner. In other words, auditors who position themselves as collaborative partners in an effort to reduce the deaf effect will be well advised to frame their risk warnings as a choice between gains rather than a choice between losses. Third, our research shows that control represents a twoedged sword. On the one hand, when perceived control over a project is high, decision makers are less apt to heed risk warnings that come from an auditor who is perceived as an opponent. Thus the combination of an auditor who is viewed as an opponent and a decision maker who perceives that s/he has high control over the outcome of the project appears to be a particularly dangerous situation because it induces the decision maker to be deaf to risk warnings. On the other hand, in terms of reducing the deaf effect, the inﬂuence of the MRR is stronger when perceived control over the project is high. Based on our ﬁndings, managers would do well to create an environment in which auditors are seen as collaborators and this is particularly true if decision makers are apt to perceive a high degree of control over the projects that they manage. All of the above implications follow directly from our data. In a somewhat more speculative vein, we suggest that both messengers (e.g., auditors) and recipients bear some responsibility for creating and maintaining a relationship that is based on collaboration as opposed to competition. If, for example, an auditor establishes a pattern of behaving in an adversarial manner, s/he should not be too surprised if recipients turn a deaf ear to the auditor’s risk warnings. Likewise, recipients who are in the habit of viewing auditors as non-value adding obstructionists are not likely to listen seriously to auditors’ risk warnings. To a certain extent, individual auditors and recipients can decide for themselves whether they choose to behave as collaborative partners or opponents. However, it is important to remember that both auditors and recipients are part of a larger organizational culture and develop of history of interactions that cannot be ignored. If auditors and recipients have a history as adversaries, a sudden shift by auditors to a more collaborative approach will not necessarily be trusted or viewed as genuine. Thus, we speculate that if auditors want to be heard it is important to build up a history in which they are viewed as collaborative partners rather than opponents. We further speculate that auditors who behave in an instrumental way, shifting opportunistically from opponent to collaborative partner and back again from project to project will not be trusted as true collaborative partners.\n",

You inherited a prestigious IS-project called PENSION-VIEW. As Project Owner, you became responsible for the successful implementation of PENSION-VIEW and for realizing the beneﬁts for your organization with this in-house developed system. With this IS-project you could be the ﬁrst insurance company in the market that grants all citizens (customers and potential customers) access to the complete set of their personal pension information. If your insurance company is the ﬁrst in the market to provide this service at a reliable level, the expected revenue to your company would be €60 million, as documented in a detailed business case for the project. Your main competitors have all decided to wait for the supplier of a standard software-package to provide a module to the insurance-market that integrates and presents their pension data. If your implementation is too late or does not prove reliable during the ﬁrst month of operations, you will miss your competitive advantage and your organization will gain nothing. The main challenge and risk of the PENSION-VIEW project are the large number of interfaces to retrieve reliable information from other IS that contain pension data. Your PENSION-VIEW project is close to implementation and under time-pressure to continue implementation as planned. According to standard procedures, Mr. Smith of the Internal Audit department has recently reviewed the testing procedures of your project. Treatments (Experiment 1) (Opponent manipulation)\n",

            "he effect of information technology (IT) on employment is a crucial question in today’s economy given the increased digitization of work. To analyze the relationship between IT use and ﬁrm-level employment, we examine the longitudinal role of IT use in the ﬁrm’s total number of employees. Our data set comes from the emerging economy of Turkey, and it represents ﬁrms of different sizes and industries. The data capture the ﬁrm’s use of enterprise applications, such as enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management, and the use of Web applications, such as e-banking and e-government. Our empirical speciﬁcations exploit both within-ﬁrm and between-ﬁrm variations to show the positive effect of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment, which varies across IT applications over time. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the effects of the use of enterprise applications materialize after two years, whereas the effects of the use of Web applications are realized in the current year. We also examine whether the role of IT use in ﬁrm-level employment are moderated by ﬁrm size, average wage rate, and industry technology intensity. The long-term effects of the use of enterprise applications on ﬁrm-level employment are more pronounced in larger ﬁrms, with higher average wages, and in high-technology industries. The results are robust to alternative speciﬁcations and tests that address causality and endogeneity concerns. Implications for research, practice, and public policy are discussed.

            "Concerns of the effects of technology on employment date back to industrialization, and they continue with rapid digitization (Economist, The 2014). Such concerns are supported by the view that if technology accomplishes more work through automation, there would be fewer jobs left for people (e.g., Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2011). On the other hand, information technology (IT) facilitates job creation and growth in ﬁrm productivity (e.g., Lichtenberg 1995; Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1996, 2003; Mittal and Nault 2009), and the literature has suggested that increases in ﬁrm productivity due to IT may also increase labor demand in the ﬁrm. For instance, enterprise applications can affect the ﬁrm’s productivity by enhancing its business processes. They can also improve the ﬁrm’s supply chain, and they can help to reach out to new suppliers and customers. The empirical evidence on the effect of IT on the ﬁrm’s labor demand is mixed (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al. 1994, Hitt 1999, Ray et al. 2013), implying that IT can either lead to smaller ﬁrms with fewer employees or larger ﬁrms with more employees. Thus, the relationship between IT and labor demand within a ﬁrm, and whether this relation has changed with recent advances in IT, is still an open research question (MIT Technology Review 2015). In this study, we focus on the\n",

            "longitudinal role of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment, speciﬁcally, whether ﬁrms employ more or less labor as they increasingly use IT. We examine how the effect of IT use on the ﬁrm’s employment is shaped by the use of different types of IT applications and several moderating variables (i.e., ﬁrm size, average wages, industry technology intensity). Our research question is, How does IT use affect ﬁrm-level employment? We employ a recent data set (2007–2011) from Turkey to examine the moderated relationship between IT use and ﬁrm-level employment. Since IT applications differ in their purpose and scale and can have different effects on economic outcomes (Weill 1992), we examine how the type of IT application, speciﬁcally, enterprise applications (e.g., enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM)) versus Web applications (e.g., e-banking, e-government, corporate website) moderates the effect of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment. Given the recent increased emphasis on Web applications relative to enterprise applications, we seek to explore how Web and enterprise applications differentially play a role in the ﬁrm’s employment. Although our ﬁrm ﬁxed-effects results show that higher IT use is linked to higher ﬁrm employment, this relationship depends on the type of IT\n",

Selected ﬁrms are required to complete the comprehensive survey by law, which ensures a high response rate (90%) and avoids the inherent problem of response bias in voluntary surveys. This makes it feasible to draw inferences about the entire population of the Turkish ﬁrms, leading to a more representative sample of ﬁrms compared to the common IT databases that primarily consist of large publicly traded companies. Second, our data set provides a reﬁned measure of IT by capturing the actual use of speciﬁc IT applications (e.g., ERP, CRM, and SCM). Going beyond aggregate IT variables, such as IT capital, IT investment, or IT spending enables us to identify the different effects of the actual use of speciﬁc IT applications on ﬁrm-level employment, thus observing relationships that cannot be determined using aggregate IT measures. Although these aggregate IT measures are valuable (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al. 1994, Hitt 1999, Bresnahan et al. 2002, Ray et al. 2013), and indeed we use them in this paper for validation, different types of IT systems, and whether they are in active use, may have differential effects. Given that the value creation potential of IT requires implementation and use after the initial purchase, and ﬁrms often fail to assimilate new IT systems, it is important to go beyond aggregate IT variables and examine actual IT use (e.g., Devaraj and Kohli 2003, Barua et al. 2004, Barki et al. 2007, Mishra and Agarwal 2010), helping us understand the microfoundations of the role of IT systems in economic outcomes (e.g., Aral et al. 2006, Forman and McElheran 2013). Third, having data on small/medium ﬁrms enables us to test the relationship between IT and labor demand by ﬁrms of different sizes. Most ﬁrm-level studies in the information systems (IS) literature rely on large public ﬁrms from the United States, such as Fortune 500 or Fortune 1000 companies. Lack of data on small and medium ﬁrms raises the question of whether empirical evidence from larger ﬁrms extends to smaller ﬁrms. This is because ﬁrms of different sizes may have different complementary resources to IT applications, or they may vary in their ability to acquire, implement, and assimilate new IT systems (e.g., Dedrick et al. 2003, Tambe and Hitt 2012).\n",

            "application over time; interestingly, enterprise applications have a long-term positive role in the ﬁrm’s employment that only materializes after two years, whereas Web applications have an immediate role that is observed in the current year. We also examine the role of IT use in ﬁrm-level employment as moderated by ﬁrm size. There is a positive link between ﬁrm size and IT investment (e.g., Harris and Katz 1991), and ﬁrm size may be an important factor in explaining variations in the magnitude and timing of IT effects on economic outcomes (e.g., Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2003, Tambe and Hitt 2012). The labor economics literature also shows that the productivity and job creation capabilities of ﬁrms differ by their size (e.g., Hall 1987; Acs and Audretsch 1988; Idson and Oi 1999). We ﬁnd that the lagged coefﬁcient of the use of enterprise applications on ﬁrm employment is signiﬁcant in large and medium ﬁrms, whereas the current coefﬁcient of the use of Web applications is signiﬁcant in small ﬁrms. Additionally, labor substitution and labor complementarity are among the mechanisms through which IT use can affect ﬁrm-level employment. IT alters the ﬁrm’s labor skill requirements and shapes the relative demand for skilled versus unskilled labor, as shown by the skill-biased technological change (SBTC) literature (e.g., Autor et al. 1998, 2003; Acemoglu 2002; Bresnahan et al. 2002; Autor and Dorn 2013). Although we do not directly observe the skill level of each employee in the data, we test the premise of SBTC theory by using the average wage rate as a proxy for the ﬁrm’s average skill level of its employees (Acemoglu 1998, 2002; Autor and Dorn 2013). We ﬁnd a stronger lagged positive relationship between the use of enterprise applications and labor demand in ﬁrms with a higher average wage rate, supporting the notion that enterprise IT use is more likely to complement skilled versus unskilled labor. Finally, we examine whether the relationship between IT use and ﬁrm-level employment differs by industry technology intensity because high-tech industry ﬁrms can have higher productivity increases associated with IT use, and they have different skill requirements than low-tech industry ﬁrms. We ﬁnd that both the lagged coefﬁcient of use of enterprise applications and the current coefﬁcient of the use of Web applications on ﬁrm employment are more pronounced in high-tech ﬁrms than in low-tech ﬁrms. We utilize ﬁrm-level IT use data collected by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) in 2007–2011 to test our research questions. The TurkStat data include variables that are not usually observed in common IT databases such as the Computer Intelligence Technology Database (Ray et al. 2013), InformationWeek (Lichtenberg 1995), and Computerworld (Brynjolfsson\n",

Table 1 presents some of the relevant empirical IS studies and summarizes their data properties to establish the incremental value of our data source. Most of the data sources quantify IT with IT capital, IT investment, or IT spending, and these aggregate IT measures are commonly used in the IS literature (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al. 1994, Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1996, Hitt 1999, Bresnahan et al. 2002, Ray et al. 2013). There is evidence that although ﬁrms purchase IT systems, they often fail to assimilate and use them (e.g., Chatterjee et al. 2002, Liang et al. 2007, Pavlou and El Sawy 2006). Notably, Devaraj and Kohli (2003) found that “actual” IT use may be a mediating variable in explaining IT effects, and omission of IT use may be the missing link in studies of the business value of IT. The few studies that do include details on the use of IT systems offer interesting results. In particular, Aral et al. (2006) found that although ERP purchase events were not correlated with increased ﬁrm productivity, ERP use (go-live) led to higher ﬁrm productivity, thereby supporting the notion that the essence of the impact of IT can be attributed to the actual use rather than mere IT investment or IT spending. Besides, Forman and McElheran (2013) found that customer-focused IT applications, supplier-focused IT applications, and the simultaneous use of these two types of IT have different effects on the ﬁrm’s vertical integration, emphasizing the complementarities in the use of different IT applications.\n",

            "The common ﬁrm-level IT databases rely on large public ﬁrms, usually Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 ﬁrms (e.g., Computer Intelligence Technology Database, InformationWeek, Computerworld). We have little understanding on whether the evidence on the economic effects of IT based on large ﬁrms generalizes to smaller ﬁrms. One exception to this is Tambe and Hitt’s (2012) study that used a unique comprehensive data set to identify interesting differences between patterns of IT returns across large Fortune 500 and medium-sized ﬁrms. The authors found that large ﬁrms realize higher productivity gains from IT investments that materialize more slowly than medium-sized ﬁrms. Other studies utilized industry-level data to overcome representation issues (e.g., Osterman 1986, Brynjolfsson et al. 1994, Mittal and Nault 2009). Industry-level analyses are important and more generalizable; however, they may miss some ﬁrm-level dynamics because ﬁrm trends and interﬁrm competition within an industry may not be captured by aggregate industry statistics. In sum, we are not aware of ﬁrm-level data in the IS literature that are representative of multiple ﬁrm sizes and industries, and our data set aims to offer a representative view across these two dimensions. Our data seek to improve on the above gaps in the literature: First, the representative design and the administrative collection of the TurkStat survey helps us to achieve a representative sample and seek to alleviate response bias. Second, the granular usage data at the IT application level helps us to observe important variations and relationships that cannot be identiﬁed using aggregate IT measures because the use of various IT applications may differ in how they\n",

            "9 we expect ﬁrm size to decrease because ﬁrms will shift a portion of their production to external sources. The change in production levels along with internal and external coordination costs can in turn affect ﬁrm-level employment. Thus, there are predictions that go in both directions following the TCE logic. Therefore, the net effect of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment can be positive, negative, or even zero, depending on whether the decrease in internal or external coordination costs dominate each other, or whether they cancel each other out. Regardless of the level of internal production, IT can change labor requirements by changing the ﬁrm’s business processes and needs of various labor skills. Brynjolfsson et al. (1994) argued that labor substitution could be the simplest explanation of why ﬁrm-level employment may be linked to IT, despite coordination costs. The SBTC literature analyzes the complementary or substitutive relationship between technology and different types of labor, arguing that the increase in the relative demand for skilled versus unskilled labor could be attributed to new technology developments (e.g., Acemoglu 1998, 2002; Bresnahan et al. 2002; Autor et al. 2003; Autor and Dorn 2013). IT substitutes for unskilled labor and routine labor tasks, and complements skilled labor and nonroutine tasks. Routine tasks can be completed by following clearly predeﬁned rules, and can therefore be replaced by IT. Some examples of routine tasks are manual assembly line jobs (e.g., packaging gadgets into containers) and cognitive clerical, administrative, or formulaic tasks (e.g., evaluating mortgage applications). By contrast, nonroutine tasks are not deﬁned by explicit rules but require human judgment, creativity, and problem solving skills. For example, a manager’s job involves analyzing complex situations and using subjective decision making, and therefore cannot be entirely performed by predetermined rules. Moreover, the high-volume and low-cost information ﬂow enabled by IT favors skilled employees who can analyze data and managers who can utilize additional insights gained from information to improve their decision making (Bresnahan et al. 2002). Accordingly, the net effect of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment can be positive, negative, or even zero, depending on whether the substitution or complementary effects of IT use dominate or cancel each other out within a given ﬁrm. 2.3. Proposed Categories of IT Applications IT applications differ in their purpose and scale, and can have varying effects on economic outcomes (Weill 1992). In this study, we make a distinction between enterprise applications and Web applications. Enterprise applications are typically large-scale systems used across the entire ﬁrm that are central to the ﬁrm’s strategy. They restructure internal and external interactions, deﬁne the ﬁrm’s business processes, and may have a\n",

Third, having data on smaller ﬁrms enables us to test the relationship between IT use and ﬁrm labor demand by ﬁrm size.1 Theoretical Foundations on the Role of IT Use in Firm-Level Employment The mechanisms through which IT use may affect ﬁrm-level employment can be attributed to (1) productivity gains, (2) make versus buy decisions, and (3) labor complementarity versus substitution. There is extensive literature on the effects of IT on ﬁrm productivity, performance, and proﬁtability (please see Dedrick et al. 2003 for a detailed review). The majority of these studies focused on the effects of IT investments on productivity (e.g., Lichtenberg 1995; Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1996, 2003; Mittal and Nault 2009) and found signiﬁcant effects, especially for ﬁrms in which IT investments coexist with complementary resources in the ﬁrm. Technological progress explains the rapid increase in a ﬁrm’s productivity, and this positive relationship between IT and productivity is well documented at the ﬁrm level. Productivity growth can lead to ﬁrm expansion and an increase in the ﬁrm’s demand for labor. On the other hand, if the ﬁrm’s production level remains the same, labor demand can decrease since fewer employees would be needed to produce the same amount of output. Similarly, the overall effect can be zero, in theory, if these two competing forces perfectly cancel each other out. IT use can also inﬂuence the make versus buy decisions, and thus alter a ﬁrm’s labor requirements. The transaction cost economics (TCE) literature explains that IT affects the allocation of the production activities through changes in the frictional costs of transactions, such as search and communication costs. The literature discusses two major types of costs: internal coordination and external coordination costs (Malone 1987, Brynjolfsson et al. 1994, Zenger and Hesterly 1997, Hitt 1999, Forman and McElheran 2013, Ray et al. 2013). Internal coordination costs include communication, data transfer, and managing employee incentives such as agency costs. External coordination costs consist of locating, communicating, maintaining external business partners, contracting, and transaction costs (e.g., Hitt 1999). The impact of IT on production depends on its relative effects on these two types of costs. If internal coordination costs decrease more than external coordination costs, we expect ﬁrms to grow internally and ﬁrm size to increase. If the decrease in external costs is greater than the decrease in internal coordination costs, 2.2.\n",

Enterprise applications require several complementary investments, changes in workplace organization, and substantial customization for their beneﬁts to be realized. ERP systems are a prime example of enterprise applications. Also, CRM and SCM systems fall in the enterprise applications category, although their role in the business processes can depend on the ﬁrm’s strategy and industry. Similarly for procurement applications, the extent of their use in the ﬁrm, their signiﬁcance and role in the ﬁrm’s business processes, and requirements for complementary organizational changes can vary across ﬁrms. Web applications are systems that deliver content and functionalities over the Internet through a Web browser and are relatively narrow-scale systems that affect the ﬁrm’s business processes and workplace organization only within speciﬁc functions in the ﬁrm. Their role in business processes is usually smaller, and they require fewer complementary changes and less customization compared to enterprise applications. Table 2 provides a brief summary of the deﬁnitions, characteristics, and examples of the proposed IT categories. The three mechanisms through which IT use can affect ﬁrm-level employment, (1) productivity gains, (2) TCE, and (3) SBTC, relate to both enterprise applications and Web applications, and we generally expect both to affect ﬁrm-level employment.

Longitudinal Role of IT Use in Firm-Level Employment We expect the effects of enterprise applications to materialize over a longer period of time compared to Web applications. An extensive body of IS literature provides compelling evidence that the returns of IT are generally more pronounced over the long term (e.g., Peffers and Dos Santos 1996, Devaraj and Kohli 2003, Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2003, Tambe and Hitt 2012). This is because ﬁrms do not simply plug in IT and enjoy its effects immediately; they have to undertake a challenging transition from their existing business processes and have to make complementary investments (e.g., Bresnahan and Greenstein 1996, Brynjolfsson et al. 2002, Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2003). Restructured business processes and changes in workplace organization are achieved through time-consuming experimentation, innovation, and redesign (e.g., Bresnahan et al. 2002). Brynjolfsson et al. (1994) showed the effects of IT investments on ﬁrm size to be most pronounced after two to three years. Besides, it takes time for employees to learn new IT systems as they follow a learning curve (e.g., Reis 1991, Peffers and Dos Santos 1996, Armstrong and Sambamurthy 1999, Singh et al. 2011). In sum, the consensus in the literature is that the long-term effects of IT are stronger than the short-term effects. The arguments and evidence in the IS literature on the lagged effects of IT are proposed to apply to enterprise applications more than Web applications.

If the SBTC logic holds, we would expect IT use to have a stronger role in employment for ﬁrms that have more skilled labor, and thus a higher average wage rate. Although we cannot observe the exact composition of the skills or occupations within each ﬁrm, testing the direction of the moderating effect would shed light on how the ﬁrm’s average skill level may play a role in IT use in the ﬁrm’s employment, at least across ﬁrms. 2.5.3. Industry Technology Intensity (High-Tech vs. Low-Tech Industry). IT use may lead to higher productivity for high-tech ﬁrms (e.g., consulting, software development) since IT is a more important component of their production function. Also, for high-tech ﬁrms, business processes often require more nonroutine labor tasks that have higher complementarities with IT. These factors can lead to a stronger positive effect of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment in high-tech industries than ﬁrms in low-tech industries with similar levels of IT use. On the other hand, high-tech ﬁrms can achieve a higher automation of routine tasks, which can reduce their demand for labor. Because we cannot unequivocally predict the direction of the role of IT use in ﬁrm-level employment when moderated by the industry’s technology intensity, this is delegated to empirical testing.\n",

            "and learning compared to Web applications. Thus, the implementation and assimilation of enterprise applications are likely to take longer than that of Web applications. Integration of Web applications requires less time because they are generally out-of-the box solutions with minimal required customization and changes in business processes. This implies that when ﬁrms start using enterprise applications, they may not experience productivity gains, changes in their coordination costs, or changes in their skill composition right away. These changes in the proposed mechanisms through which IT use inﬂuence the ﬁrm’s labor demand would occur more slowly when using enterprise applications compared to Web applications. Therefore, the effect of enterprise applications on ﬁrm-level employment is likely to materialize slower than that of Web applications. Similarly, the effect of Web applications on ﬁrm-level employment is expected to materialize faster due to their easier assimilation, thus leading to higher current effects on labor demand within the ﬁrm compared to enterprise applications, although we cannot unequivocally predict the direction of these proposed effects. Moderated Role of IT Use in Firm-Level Employment 2.5.1. Firm Size. A ﬁrm’s size can play a role in how the relationship between IT use and its labor demand materializes over time, although there is scarce evidence across ﬁrms of different sizes. For the effects of IT investments to be realized in practice, they must be accompanied by changes in business processes and the organizational structure. These accompanying changes often take a longer time to occur in large ﬁrms given the bigger organization. In fact, the effects of IT investments on ﬁrm productivity were shown to materialize more slowly in larger ﬁrms (Tambe and Hitt 2012). Similarly, economic effects can be realized more quickly in smaller ﬁrms because the implementation, assimilation, and use of IT applications are generally easier compared to larger ﬁrms. Therefore, we expect larger ﬁrms to experience stronger lagged effects from their use of IT applications compared to small ﬁrms, although we cannot predict the magnitudes of these effects. 2.5.2. Average Wage Rate. IT can substitute for low-skilled labor and routine tasks, but it can also complement high-skilled labor and nonroutine tasks, as documented by the SBTC literature. Wage rate is the most common empirical measure of skill level in the economics literature (e.g., Acemoglu 1998, 2002; Autor and Dorn 2013). Thus, we use the average wage rate as a proxy for the ﬁrm’s average skill level since we cannot measure the exact distribution of skilled and unskilled labor within the ﬁrm.

The surveys are conducted for ﬁrms that have 10 or more employees, including both public and private ﬁrms, in the following industry categories: manufacturing, energy, construction, wholesale/retail trade, transportation, accommodation and food service activities, information and communication, real estate, professional, scientiﬁc/technical activities, and administrative and support activities (please see Online\n",

The industry categories are based on Eurostat’s Statistical Classiﬁcation of Economic Activities in the European Community, referred to as NACE, which is the European equivalent of the North American Industry Classiﬁcation System (NAICS) in the United States. Stratiﬁed random sampling was used by taking into account TurkStat’s ﬁrm size classes and industries (NACE Rev.2). Therefore, the TurkStat survey is representative of the industries and size categories according to the shares of the population for each given year.4 The data are administratively collected by the Turkish government, and ﬁrms that are selected for the survey are required to provide information by law. The IT use survey is required to be ﬁlled out by a manager in the IT department, or, for smaller ﬁrms without an IT department, by someone who works with computers and software. If ﬁrms do not respond, they pay a monetary ﬁne that is added to their tax debts automatically, and they are still required to respond immediately. Also, TurkStat keeps contacting these ﬁrms several times. These steps help to increase the response rates and representation of the survey. Around 90% of the ﬁrms responded to the survey each year (see Online Appendix 2, Table A5). Accordingly, the data are representative nationally and across the size categories and industries noted above. However, they may not be representative regionally (e.g., cities, provinces, etc.) since this is not pursued by TurkStat by design. The IT use survey is an unbalanced panel where the number of observations ranged from 3,363 in 2007 to over 8,000 in 2011. We matched the ﬁrm-level IT use data set with the ﬁrm-level Annual Industry and Service Statistics data set of TurkStat, which is the most comprehensive ﬁrm-level survey in Turkey, representative of the population of ﬁrms with 10 or more employees.5 This survey contains ﬁnancial information and ﬁrm characteristics, such as sales, wages, and assets. For our main speciﬁcation, we used ﬁrm ﬁxed effects models to utilize within-ﬁrm variation for identiﬁcation because ﬁrms with different levels of IT use signiﬁcantly differ across observable dimensions, implying that there can be several other unobservable differences\n",
            "Small ﬁrms have 10–49 employees, medium-sized ﬁrms have 50–249 employees, and large ﬁrms have 250 employees or more. The representation parameters include design weights, adjustments for nonresponse, external distribution checks, and an ultimate multiplying factor.

            "not captured by the data. Among the 13,231 unique ﬁrms in the matched full sample, 9,115 ﬁrms exist for only one year during the panel, and thus they cannot be used for any ﬁrm ﬁxed effects model. Additionally, we wanted to identify two-year lagged coefﬁcients, which require at least four years of observations per ﬁrm in the ﬁrm ﬁxed effects model. There are 1,103 ﬁrms that exist for at least four years in the panel (620 ﬁrms exist for four years and 483 ﬁrms exist for ﬁve years), resulting in a total of 4,895 observations (please see Online Appendix 2 for more details). Accordingly, for our main empirical analysis, we maintained this particular sample across all speciﬁcations. Firms included in the ﬁnal sample tend to be larger and have higher levels of IT use than the entire set of ﬁrms. TurkStat employs stratiﬁed random sampling to select ﬁrms within the size categories in each industry. In the entire population of Turkish ﬁrms, the total number of small and medium ﬁrms (fewer than 250 employees) is greater than the total number of large ﬁrms (250 or more employees). Since there is a smaller pool of large ﬁrms compared with the pool of small and medium ﬁrms, a given large ﬁrm has a higher probability of being selected for the survey in consecutive years and appearing longitudinally in the data. Besides, larger ﬁrms typically have a higher probability of survival over time than small ﬁrms. Thus, our ﬁnal sample, where we retain ﬁrms that have at least four years of observations, is biased toward larger ﬁrms. We discuss the implications of this sampling issue for our ﬁndings in §4. We used TurkStat’s ﬁrm IT use data set because of its advantages over the common IT databases in the United States in terms of information on different types of IT application use and representation. However, we note that several market and country characteristics of Turkey might affect the relationship between IT use and the ﬁrm’s labor demand differently compared to other countries. For example, market frictions and labor regulations are generally high in Turkey, which is similar to other European countries, such as France and Germany. Business transactions have higher value added tax rates in Turkey compared to the United States. These differences can render market-based transactions costly for Turkish ﬁrms. All factors that create high market frictions may encourage ﬁrms to expand more internally as a result of IT use rather than through market-based transactions. Additionally, the Turkish economy has been experiencing high growth rates since the mid-2000s (for example, in our sample, the average sales growth rate is 8.2%). We discuss these country characteristics and how they relate to our ﬁndings in detail in §5. 3.1. Measuring the Firm’s Type of IT Use A novel feature of the data is the information on the use of speciﬁc IT applications. The IT use survey consists of\n",

            "several indicator variables that denote whether a certain IT application is in active use at the ﬁrm. We focus on seven IT applications that were measured over the ﬁveyear panel: ERP, CRM, SCM, procurement, e-banking, e-government, and corporate website.6 Table 3 presents the descriptions and examples of each IT application (as indicated in the TurkStat survey). These seven IT use variables are highly correlated with each other, and using them all together in a single speciﬁcation leads to multicollinearity. We ﬁrst ran the analysis using each IT application one at a time. The challenge in this case is that we could not identify the incremental effect of each IT application, controlling for the presence of the others, leading to potential omitted variable bias. Hence, we conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) to investigate whether these variables of interest are linearly related to a smaller number of factors that explain the same amount of variation. PCA can enable grouping of the IT use indicators into more meaningful categories by exploring which IT applications are used together and thus share a common variance. Additionally, having multiple measures of a latent ﬁrm variable, such as “enterprise application use,” decreases measurement error and introduces another beneﬁt of reducing the number of variables and summarizing them into different categories. Two factors were retained from PCA, resulting in two categories: the ﬁrst group consists of ERP, CRM, SCM, and procurement, whereas the second group is e-banking, e-government, and corporate website (see Online Appendix 1). This grouping implies that the IT applications in each category are frequently used together. In other words, ﬁrms that use ERP also tend to use CRM, SCM, and procurement (or the other way around), and therefore it is hard to identify their individual effects because they share a common variation. The PCA approach allows us to utilize the same amount of variation among all seven IT use indicators with two factors, thus avoiding multicollinearity. Moreover, this grouping is meaningful\n",

            "because the ﬁrst group includes large, ﬁrmwide enterprise applications that affect several business processes, and the second group includes small, narrow-scale electronic applications with a speciﬁc use. We term the IT applications in the ﬁrst category as enterprise applications and the ones in the second category as Web applications. We summarize the indicator variables within each of these two groups into a single index by using the normalized PCA loadings as weights. This leads to two IT-use indices between 0 and 1 for each ﬁrm: (a) enterprise application use index and (b) Web application use index. We checked the robustness of the results by using different weights for the indices (such as equal) as well as different groupings of these IT applications and the results were similar (please see Online Appendix 3). 3.2. Summary Statistics Table 4 presents the summary statistics of the main variables for the ﬁnal sample of ﬁrms that have at least four years of observations and for the full sample of ﬁrms, which includes all observations. The averages of the individual IT applications represent the proportions of ﬁrm-years that have the system in use. The percentage of ﬁrm-years that use ERP systems is 59%, the percentage that use CRM is 34%, and the percentage that use SCM is 30%. On average, ﬁrms use 47% of the enterprise applications and 87% of the Web applications. The enterprise application use and the Web application use indices used in our analyses vary from 0 to 1, representing a weighted scheme of the IT applications included in each index. The means for the enterprise application use index and the Web application use index are 0.411 and 0.866, respectively, slightly differing from the averages reported above since the indices do not weigh the IT applications evenly. Overall, the use of enterprise applications is less prevalent than the use of Web applications because enterprise applications are typically more costly and challenging to implement. Comparing the summary statistics across the ﬁnal sample and the full sample, ﬁrms that are retained in the ﬁnal sample for the longitudinal analysis tend to be larger with higher levels of IT use than the ﬁrms in the full sample because of the nature of the sampling, as described in detail above.\n",

            "of endogeneity. First, ﬁrms that have different IT use levels may be systematically different from each other (unobserved heterogeneity). We may be able to observe some of these different characteristics; still, unobserved differences may remain. Indeed, we ﬁnd ﬁrms with different levels of IT application use to differ across observable dimensions, suggesting that there can be other differences that we may fail to observe. We used ﬁrm ﬁxed effects to account for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity across ﬁrms. Hence, our identiﬁcation is driven by within-ﬁrm changes in IT use and ﬁrm-level employment over time, and not by permanent unobserved differences across ﬁrms. Another potential source of endogeneity could be omitted variable bias, such as a positive shock to the ﬁrm’s cash ﬂows, that will affect both IT use and employment levels. Also, growing ﬁrms may have a greater demand for communication tools and enterprise systems, such as ERP. High growth ﬁrms that invest both in IT and labor can lead to a spurious positive correlation between the two variables. Some of these confounding ﬁrm-level trends can be due to macroeconomic conditions and business cycles. First, we included time ﬁxed effects to control for time speciﬁc shocks to the economy experienced by all ﬁrms. Time ﬁxed effects also control for national factors that can affect employment, such as changes in population, labor force, and unemployment rates.

On the other hand, e-banking, e-government, and website applications have signiﬁcant current coefﬁcients, where all their lagged coefﬁcients are insigniﬁcant with small magnitudes. In column (4), the procurement application has signiﬁcant one-year and two-year lagged coefﬁcients, differing slightly from the enterprise applications that only have effects after two years, and also differing from the Web applications that have current year effects. Although the procurement clusters with the other enterprise applications (ERP, CRM, SCM) in the PCA, its effects materialize relatively faster. These results may imply that the timing of the effects of the procurement application lies in between that of the enterprise applications and Web applications. Therefore, for robustness checks, we used various alternative categorizations where the procurement application was included in the Web application use index versus the enterprise application use index, the procurement application was not included in either index, and the procurement application was totally omitted from the analysis (please see Online Appendix 3 for more details). Omitted variables are potential problems in Table 5. For example, ERP and CRM variables are highly correlated. In columns (1) and (2), we included ERP and CRM one at a time in different regressions, and it is uncertain whether the signiﬁcant effect of CRM use is due to its correlation to the ERP use (or vice versa). To estimate the incremental effects of each IT application, we needed to control for the presence of other IT applications in each speciﬁcation. However, IT use indicators have high correlations with each other, and including all IT use indicators in one speciﬁcation leads to multicollinearity problems because this requires estimation of 21 highly correlated coefﬁcients (i.e., three coefﬁcients for each IT application, current use, one-year lagged use, and two-year lagged use). Thus, we employed the enterprise use and Web application use categories obtained with PCA, which groups the IT applications based on their common variance. Table 6 presents the estimates of the effects of enterprise application and Web application use levels on log ﬁrm-level employment over time. In column (1), we include only the current IT use indices, and introduced one-year lagged and two-year lagged IT use measures in columns (2) and (3), respectively.7 The results indicate that enterprise applications do not\n",

We also used additional control variables to account for ﬁrm growth and performance, and how ﬁrms may be affected by economic conditions. Since current values of control variables might be directly driven by current employment levels and thus could be highly enodogenous, we used lagged values. Control variables included lagged sales, sales growth rate between the past and current year, lagged assets, and lagged costs capturing shocks that might affect a ﬁrm’s cash ﬂows and performance. Related to the shocks in the ﬁrm’s labor strategy, we controlled for the lagged ratio of termination fees to total costs since termination fees may reﬂect labor downsizing policies in a ﬁrm. In the speciﬁcations where the control variables were removed, we found that failing to control for sales growth and other variables that account for ﬁrm performance results in an upward bias in the estimated coefﬁcients (please see Table A10 in Online Appendix 3 for details). We also exploited the panel structure of the data and analyzed the timing of changes in IT use and employment to test for reverse causality. This is similar to the Granger (1969) causality test, which is a common test between two variables in a time series context. We found that past levels of IT use predict current employment levels, whereas past employment levels do not predict current IT use. This ﬁnding indicates that changes in IT precede changes in employment, and hence the evidence does not support reverse causality and suggests that the causal direction is from IT use to ﬁrm-level employment only. We addressed some potential remaining endogeneity bias using generalized propensity score (GPS) matching by taking advantage of the rich data set. GPS estimates rely on a different identifying assumption where only observed heterogeneity is accounted for, and they conﬁrm a similar positive relationship. Nonetheless, despite using several methods to address potential endogeneity, the results could still be subject to unobserved timevarying factors that cannot be captured in the data, such as an unobserved positive shock that manifests its effect over time, affecting both the ﬁrm’s IT use and employment levels.

In column (3), we include two-year lagged IT use variables, and this leads to losing two years of observations per ﬁrm and a total of 2,689 observations (4,985 − 2 × 1,103 = 2,689, or 483 × 3 + 620 × 2 = 2,689). This interpretation is for cases when ﬁrms start using all associated IT applications in one year; however, this change may not be reasonable empirically. Hence, we also interpret the coefﬁcients based on a one-application increase. Enterprise and Web application use indices are weighted averages of the corresponding applications based on PCA weights; therefore, the change in the indices based on a oneapplication increase would depend on which speciﬁc IT application is added. Here, we interpret the changes in equally weighted IT use indices as averages. The effect of one additional enterprise application use on log (employment), on average, would be 0 219 × 0 25 = 0 547, which suggests about a 5.5% increase in the employment level within the ﬁrm. The estimated effect of one additional Web application use on log (employment) is 0 125 × 0 33 = 0 04125 or about a 4.1% increase in the level of ﬁrm-level employment.\n",

Overall, the results imply that the effects of the use of enterprise applications take time to manifest themselves, whereas the use of Web applications has immediate effects that are realized in the current year. In our ﬁnal sample, we retain ﬁrms that have at least four years of observations to be able to identify longitudinal effects. The sampling issues outlined in §3 might lead to an underestimation of the marginal effects of IT use on ﬁrm employment for two reasons. First, the ﬁrms in the ﬁnal sample tend to be larger with higher levels of IT use, and thus realize a lower rate of change in their IT use during the sample period. Our identifying variation comes from within-ﬁrm changes, and thus we may not be able to identify marginal effects for some of the large ﬁrms that already have very high levels of IT use. These ﬁrms that can be viewed as early adopters may be the ones that received the largest returns from IT, which we may not be able to capture in our estimates. Second, there is a lower probability for smaller ﬁrms to be present in the ﬁnal panel, and this can lead to the omission of important identifying variations from these ﬁrms that\n",

Second, we did not restrict the analysis to the ﬁnal sample across speciﬁcations to include more ﬁrms from the full sample where possible and found similar results (see Online Appendix 3, Table A10). Effects of IT Use on Firm-Level Employment by Firm Size To analyze whether the relationship between IT use and ﬁrm-level employment varies by ﬁrm size, we divided the sample into terciles to create size groups. The ﬁrms in the bottom one-third of the size distribution were placed in the small category, ﬁrms in the middle were placed in the medium category, and those in the top one-third were placed in the large category. To estimate the coefﬁcients of lagged IT use, we conditioned the analysis on the initial size category to identify the effects over time. Table 7 shows the results where the IT use variables are interacted with the ﬁrm’s size category. The baseline category is small ﬁrms; the interaction terms between IT use and medium-sized (or large) ﬁrms show the differences between small and medium-sized (or large) ﬁrms. The enterprise application use coefﬁcients are not signiﬁcant for small ﬁrms. The two-year lagged coefﬁcient of enterprise application use is signiﬁcantly higher in large versus small ﬁrms; however, the difference between large and medium ﬁrms is not statistically signiﬁcant. Also, the current Web application use coefﬁcient is signiﬁcant for small ﬁrms, but insigniﬁcant for medium and large ﬁrms. In sum, enterprise application use is associated with a higher labor demand over time for medium and large ﬁrms; by contrast, Web application use is associated with a higher labor demand for small ﬁrms. Effects of IT Use on Firm-Level Employment by Average Wage Rate We used the average wage rate per employee as a proxy for the average skill level of the ﬁrm’s employees. Table 8 presents the results of the interactions between the average wage rate and the IT use indices. The two-year lagged coefﬁcient of enterprise application use on ﬁrm-level employment is stronger for ﬁrms with higher average wages. On the other hand, the interaction term between the current Web application use and the average wage rate is not statistically signiﬁcant, implying that the relationship between Web application use and ﬁrm labor demand does not vary with the ﬁrm’s wage levels. It should be noted that average wages could also vary due to several other factors besides skills, such as location and industry, and thus there can be several alternative explanations to the ﬁndings. Nonetheless, we may interpret the stronger positive longitudinal relationship between the enterprise application use and the ﬁrm’s labor demand 4.5. 4.4.\n",

This is especially true for Web application use that has a high mean and a low standard deviation, and may possibly have low marginal returns on the ﬁrm’s labor demand, simply because the diffusion of Web applications is signiﬁcantly higher than the diffusion of enterprise applications across all ﬁrms, making it harder for us to detect their effects. This is an inevitable sampling bias inherent in the survey, and we conducted two robustness checks that expand the representation to make sure our results are not driven by the bias toward larger ﬁrms that have higher IT use levels.

On the other hand, the two-year lagged coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant for medium-tech and high-tech ﬁrms and insigniﬁcant for low-tech ﬁrms. Similarly, current Web application use coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant for high-tech and medium-tech ﬁrms, but not for low-tech ﬁrms. We found that both enterprise and Web application use coefﬁcients are stronger in medium- and high-tech ﬁrms compared to low-tech ﬁrms, but they are not statistically different between medium- and high-tech ﬁrms. Generalized Propensity Score Matching of Firms We further addressed the endogeneity issue by conducting analyses based on a different assumption and providing evidence that our results are not driven by a particular identiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we used the GPS matching method that accounts for the observable heterogeneity across ﬁrms by estimating the effects of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment comparing only ﬁrms that are similar across observables. Hirano and Imbens (2004) and Imai and Van Dyke (2004) developed the GPS method to be an extension of the binary treatment propensity scores (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983) with continuous treatment variables (for GPS application examples, please see Bia and Mattei 2008, Kluve et al. 2012). The idea is to match the ﬁrms that are most similar along several characteristics that determine IT use and ﬁrm employment levels simultaneously to eliminate the bias associated with differences in observables. This method ﬁrst predicts the IT use based on observable characteristics, such as industry, sales, sales growth, investment, loss, and other ﬁnancial and business statistics. This is one of the main differences of the GPS matching method compared to regression based methods, as GPS estimates the level of the independent variable rather than using the actual realized levels, which are potentially endogenous. The ﬁrst step is to estimate the conditional density of the treatment given the covariates by using the equation r t x = fT X t x , where T is the treatment level (IT use index in this case) and X represents the observable covariates. The generalized propensity score is R = r T X . Next, we estimate the conditional expectation of the outcome (ﬁrm-level employment) as a function of the treatment level T (IT use index) and GPS level R (estimated IT use index), t r = E Y T = t R = r . To estimate the dose-response function at a particular level of treatment, we averaged this conditional expectation over the GPS at a particular level of IT use (which is denoted by t ): t = E t r t x . To evaluate whether this speciﬁcation of the propensity score is adequate, we examined how it affects the balancing of covariates. We divided the IT use indices into three levels and examined whether the adjusted 4.7.\n",

            "mean in each level is different from the adjusted means in the other two levels. Covariates are not balanced when unadjusted, meaning that ﬁrms with different levels of IT use signiﬁcantly differ across their observable dimensions. These observable covariates are balanced when adjusted for GPS. The means of the covariates are not statistically different from each other across the three levels of estimated IT use. This indicates that the GPS method was able to correct for any observable heterogeneity among ﬁrms. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) present the dose-response functions and corresponding treatment effect functions estimated by GPS. The ﬁrst part of each graph presents the dose-response function, which shows the distribution of outcome for the corresponding levels of IT use. The second part of each graph presents the treatment effect function, which is the derivative of the doseresponse function. In economic terminology, these are the marginal effects: t + t − t . In Figures 1(a) and 1(b), we report the dose-response differences (marginal effects) distribution, for an increase of 0.1 in the IT use indices t + 0 1 − t from each IT use level and the corresponding 95% conﬁdence bands calculated by bootstrapping. For instance, in Figure 1(a), if the current enterprise application use index increases from 0.6 to 0.7 t + 0 1 = 0 6 + 0 1 = 0 7 , the number of employees would increase by 0.75%. The marginal effects are increasing, indicating a convex relationship for current enterprise use and ﬁrm-level employment. Figure 1(b) shows that the marginal lagged effect of the use of enterprise applications is increasing at a decreasing rate, implying a concave relationship between lagged use and ﬁrm-level employment. The total effect was still larger for higher levels of lagged enterprise application use. However, the marginal positive effects are diminishing over time as ﬁrms use more enterprise applications (the cumulative effect still increases). The current marginal effects of Web application use are not statistically signiﬁcant (see\n",
            "\n",
            "Online Appendix 3). The lagged effects of Web application use are more precisely estimated than current effects, where an increase in Web application use by 0.1 corresponds to about a 2% increase in employment (for Web application use index levels above 0.4). These magnitudes are not directly comparable to regression coefﬁcients that report average effects because GPS provides effects for different levels of IT use, and the average would depend on the actual distribution. We also found different results using GPS, and one potential reason for this is the difference in the identifying assumption and the possibility of remaining unobserved heterogeneity in the GPS analysis. This can imply that there are unobservable variables that play a signiﬁcant role in the relationship between IT use and the ﬁrm’s labor demand. However, the GPS results indicate positive effects of both enterprise application use and Web application use on ﬁrm-level employment, consistent with the ﬁxed effects results. Although GPS is informative on causal effects in rich data sets with many observables, it suffers from unobserved variable bias, which can be addressed by ﬁxed-effects. In summary, these results complement each other, since they conﬁrm a similar pattern with two different identifying assumptions. 4.8. Robustness Checks\n",

Additionally, we used several alternative measures of IT use.

Finally, we conducted robustness checks with different categorizations of the procurement application.

The dependent variables (DVs) in columns (1)–(3) are the levels of enterprise application use, and the dependent variables in columns (4)–(6) are the levels of Web application use. Current and lagged ﬁrm-level employment levels are not correlated with enterprise application use. Also, past levels of ﬁrm employment do not predict Web application use, but there is a positive correlation between Web application use and current employment levels (as in the main analysis). These results, combined with the ﬁnding that changes in ﬁrm employment follow changes in enterprise application use from our main analysis, support a causal direction from IT use to ﬁrm-level employment. 4.8.2. Effects of IT Use on Average Wage Rates. We also analyzed the relationship between IT use and average wage rates to examine whether the increase in the number of employees in the ﬁrm is accompanied by a change in average wage. In Table 11, the dependent variable is log average wages, and the independent variables are current and lagged IT use levels. We also controlled for the number of employees. There are signiﬁcant one-year lagged coefﬁcients of enterprise application use. Although the use of Web applications also shows large positive coefﬁcients, they are not statistically signiﬁcant due to large standard errors. Overall, these results imply that the increase in the number of employees is not at the expense of lower average wages at the ﬁrm, and there can be positive effects of the use of IT applications on both workers’ average wages and employment.\n",

Key Findings This paper analyzes the longitudinal effects of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment and how they differ by IT application types and are moderated by (1) ﬁrm size, (2) average wage rate, and (3) industry technology intensity. We found a positive relationship between IT use and ﬁrm-level employment on average, and the relationship varies by the category of IT applications. The results show that the use of enterprise applications affects ﬁrm-level employment over time, whereas the effects of the use of Web applications materialize in the current year. We found that the use of all four enterprise IT applications is associated with about a 22% higher ﬁrm labor demand, and this effect materializes after two years in medium and large ﬁrms. The use of all Web applications is linked to about a 12.5% higher ﬁrm labor demand, and this effect is observed in the current year in small ﬁrms.10 We also showed that the longitudinal relationship between the use of enterprise applications and ﬁrm-level employment is more pronounced in larger ﬁrms with higher average wages in high-tech industries, whereas the current effects of the use of Web\n",

Although we cannot directly compare our main ﬁndings to previous studies on IT and ﬁrm labor demand, since we do not have measures of aggregate IT spending or IT capital at the ﬁrm, we observe sizeable effects in terms of the magnitudes. For example, Brynjolfsson et al. (1994) found that a 1% increase in IT investment leads to a 0.13% decrease in employees per establishment. Similar 1% increases in enterprise and Web application use at their sample averages are associated with about 0.09% and 0.10% increases in ﬁrm-level employment, respectively. However, this calculation does not take into account the empirical distributions of the IT use variables.\n",

Compared to the United States, the labor market in Turkey is more regulated, which is a common characteristic among European countries, such as France and Germany. Moreover, the high growth rates observed in developing and emerging economies release the sales constraints on the ﬁrm’s cash ﬂows that enable further ﬁrm expansion. Combining all these factors, ﬁrms may ﬁnd it optimal to grow internally rather than externally in a market with high external frictions and potential for internal growth, and IT use can thus lead to higher ﬁrm-level employment. The distinctions in these market characteristics can explain some of the differences between our results and previous studies that found a negative relationship between IT investments and ﬁrm size (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al. 1994, Hitt 1999). Since there is not much evidence on the economic effects of IT in developing countries and emerging economies, this study can have direct implications for developing countries with high growth rates, and further research can shed more light on our ﬁndings. Finally, this study is likely to have indirect implications for developed countries that are similar to Turkey in terms of market characteristics, such as many European countries. 5.3. Implications for Practice and Public Policy The effect of IT on employment has been an important practical and public policy question because there are concerns that innovation and growth due to IT can also have potential job-destroying effects. The relationship between IT use and aggregate employment includes different components, such as workers, ﬁrms, and local and national labor markets. Several studies analyzed the role of IT in regional employment, and empirical evidence indicates that greater IT infrastructure and IT use in local areas are associated with higher regional employment and average wages (e.g., Crandall et al. 2007, Kolko 2010, Forman et al. 2012, Atasoy 2013). One of the key questions in this literature is whether the\n",

Turkey ranks 69th among 177 countries in the 2013 Index of Economic Freedom, France ranks 61st, whereas the United States ranks 10th (low ranking numbers represent higher economic freedom). Also, the relative tax burden in the 2013 Index of Economic Freedom ranks Turkey 109th out of 185 countries, whereas the United States ranks 148th (low ranking numbers suggest a higher tax burden).

            "applications are more pronounced in small ﬁrms. The results are robust to GPS matching and several tests that address endogeneity concerns. However, it should be noted that there can be alternative explanations to the ﬁndings, especially for the moderated relationships, since ﬁrm size, average wage rate, and industry can be correlated with unobserved factors. 5.2. Contributions and Implications for Research We used recent nationally representative ﬁrm-level data provided by the TurkStat that include information on the use of different types of IT applications. The ﬁndings supplement our understanding derived from the other data sources (Table 1) in three main aspects. The ﬁrst advantage of our data is that the selected ﬁrms are required to complete the TurkStat survey by law, and this led to a high response rate and a sample of a comprehensive set of ﬁrms, thus enabling us to draw inferences that are more applicable to the entire population of Turkish ﬁrms. Second, there is detailed information on the use of speciﬁc IT applications, such as ERP, SCM, and CRM. This allowed us to test the effects of the use of speciﬁc IT applications and gain an understanding of how enterprise versus Web applications might inﬂuence the ﬁrm’s employment, which may not be readily identiﬁed with aggregate IT measures, such as IT capital, IT investments, or IT spending. Going beyond an aggregate measure of IT enables us to provide insights on the role of speciﬁc IT applications in ﬁrm outcomes, similar to Aral et al. (2006) and Forman and McElheran (2013). Third, our data include smaller ﬁrms across industries, whereas the majority of IT studies are primarily based on large, publicly traded ﬁrms (one exception is Tambe and Hitt 2012). This allows us to test the relationship between IT use and ﬁrm labor demand for ﬁrms of different sizes. Most of the IS literature has relied on data from the United States to show that IT investments can lead to either smaller or larger ﬁrms (Brynjolfsson et al. 1994, Hitt 1999, Forman and McElheran 2013, Ray et al. 2013). In our data from Turkey, IT use is associated with higher ﬁrm-level employment, on average. The differences between our results and the IS literature may arise from IT measurement and country characteristics. In terms of context-speciﬁc distinctions, country and time frame differences can play an important role. Our data are from a developing country, Turkey, which is considered to be a high-growth emerging economy. There are market characteristics of Turkey that may affect the relationship between IT use and ﬁrm-level employment. First, the role of IT in the ﬁrm’s internal and external coordination costs can be different in Turkey. One possible explanation is the high business-to-business transaction taxes (18% value-added tax) in Turkey, which may limit the ability of IT to reduce external transaction costs. Furthermore, even though IT use may\n",
            "\n",
            "\f24 positive relationship between IT and regional employment is due to increasing the number of ﬁrms in the region, or caused by each ﬁrm in the region hiring more employees. Our study explicitly focuses on the relationship between IT use and ﬁrm-level employment, and our data cannot directly infer about the broader effects of IT use on aggregate employment levels at regional or national labor markets. Nonetheless, the effect of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment remains an important question to fully understand the interplay between IT, labor markets, and aggregate-level employment. A main practical and policy implication at the ﬁrm level is that IT is not necessarily replacing all types of jobs in the ﬁrm, and can create a positive net impact on the ﬁrm’s total number of employees. The effects can be larger for labor in sectors that employ skills complementary to IT. The positive relationship between IT use and the ﬁrm’s labor demand is more pronounced in ﬁrms with higher average wages and high-tech ﬁrms, supporting this logic. However, similar to many economic effects realized through IT, the effects on ﬁrm employment can materialize gradually over time, particularly for enterprise applications, and this should be taken into account in managerial and public policies that seek to stimulate jobs through IT investments. Turkey has been experiencing fast growth rates over the last decade, except during the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2008 and 2009. This was reﬂected in the national unemployment rate, which reached as high as 14% during the ﬁnancial crisis. The unemployment rate recovered back to its precrisis levels of 9%–10% in 2010 and thereafter. We controlled for the macroeconomic time trends in our analysis, and the signs of time dummies in the ﬁrm-level employment regressions reﬂected this trend, although they are not statistically signiﬁcant. We found a positive relationship between IT use and ﬁrm-level employment, on average, after taking into account these shocks to national employment. Since our ﬁnal panel sample tends to be larger ﬁrms that survived the economic downturns, some of the positive effects of IT use may be offset in the aggregate employment levels by ﬁrms that did not survive, or non-IT savvy ﬁrms, which may have lost employment. In other words, IT-oriented ﬁrms can grow at the expense of other ﬁrms. Thus, ﬁrm-level employment effects might not directly translate into aggregate-level employment effects. However, our results could be cautiously generalized to imply that the use of IT may also contribute to the national employment growth, and policies aiming to expand the use of IT can be important tools for stimulating employment growth and job creation beyond the ﬁrm level.\n",

            "Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research There are certain limitations to this study that create interesting opportunities for future research. First, we used ﬁve-year panel data, and although we could identify up to two-year lagged coefﬁcients, this is still a relatively short time frame to analyze longer-term effects. Compared with research in developed countries, IT investment and IT use are relatively recent topics of interest in developing countries, such as Turkey. Detailed census panel data on IT use that is consistent over a longer period of time would be useful for further longitudinal analysis. We provided empirical evidence from the speciﬁc context of Turkey, and we discussed several market characteristics that are likely to play a role in the relationship between IT use and ﬁrm-level employment. Market frictions and regulations can vary signiﬁcantly across countries leading to differential impacts of IT on ﬁrm employment. Empirical research from other developing countries is needed to demonstrate the generalizability of our results. The positive effects of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment can be attributed to at least three mechanisms, which are not directly testable with our data: (a) productivity gains, (b) decrease in internal coordination costs relatively more than external coordination costs, and (c) increase in complementary (skilled) labor due to IT relatively more than a decrease in substitutable (unskilled) labor due to automation due to IT (following SBTC theory). We related to the ﬁnal mechanism using average wages as a proxy for the average labor skill in the ﬁrm; however, direct data on skills, education, or occupations of all workers would provide a better test for SBTC theory, because wages may vary for many other reasons besides skills. This type of information can also provide evidence on who beneﬁts from the use of IT at the ﬁrm the most because the beneﬁts from IT are not likely to be equally distributed among different occupations and skills. Future research could explore the change in composition of skills and tasks within ﬁrms and question which occupations beneﬁt or suffer as IT use increases. This has implications for workers as to which skills they should invest in to stay competitive in the labor market by matching the fast pace of IT growth. Endogeneity is a key empirical challenge when studying the economic effects of IT, and the relationship between IT use and ﬁrm employment is not an exception. We used many approaches to address endogeneity, and each has its own underlying assumption. We address time-invariant, unobserved heterogeneity across ﬁrms with ﬁrm ﬁxed effects models. Controlling for past sales and sales growth rates accounts for some of the confounding ﬁrm trends. Timing indicates that changes in ﬁrm employment follow changes in IT use over time, providing evidence against reverse causality.\n",

            "GPS accounts for observed heterogeneity, and it shows that there is a positive relationship between IT use and the ﬁrm’s labor demand under this different identifying assumption. However, we cannot completely rule out all alternative explanations, such as unobserved time-varying factors that may simultaneously increase IT use and ﬁrm employment over time. Finally, although our study provides insights by offering empirical evidence on the effects of IT use on ﬁrm-level employment, understanding the broader effects of IT use on employment is essential. Still, the TurkStat data are not representative at a regional level, which prevents us from deriving direct implications for local, regional, or national labor markets, implications that would be of great interest from a public policy perspective. We hope that our study on the role of IT use in ﬁrm-level employment is a modest step toward stimulating future research on the broader effects of IT use on labor demand. 5.5. Concluding Remarks The alleged job-destroying effect of technology has been a concern since industrialization, and it remains an important question for IS research today given the rapid digitization of the economy. For example, the “lump of labor” fallacy assumes that the amount of work is ﬁxed, and there are fewer jobs available as IT can automate tasks and substitute for unskilled labor (e.g., Autor et al. 2003, Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2011, Autor and Dorn 2013). This seems to be a misbelief because IT can also increase labor demand by increasing productivity levels. Productivity increases were shown to increase labor demand by previous research; however, whether this relationship has continued in recent years remains an unanswered question (MIT Technology Review 2015). Moreover, how IT affects labor demand depends on the unit of analysis since the effects of IT can be different at the ﬁrm, regional, and national levels. In this study, we focused on the role of IT applications in labor demand at the ﬁrm level using a unique data set from Turkey. Our results imply that, at least in our context, the use of IT applications can increase ﬁrmlevel employment. This study is a modest step toward fully understanding the role of IT in labor demand at the ﬁrm level and ultimately in aggregate employment by offering microlevel evidence on the role of IT use in ﬁrm-level employment.

ABSTRACT: Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software is a platform for innovation with high failure rates due to its complexity. In China, failure rates of ERP are also high, with key differences between China and Western countries in terms of development, cultural, and organizational structure. Even when Chinese firms successfully adopt ERP, many fail to assimilate ERP and consequently never experience the full benefits of the innovation. The purpose of this study is to examine the predictors of adoption versus assimilation in Chinese firms. The existing literature largely assumes a dichotomy of choices when implementing organizational innovations in\n",

China has achieved tremendous success in manufacturing and industrial processes through technological leapfrogging offered by imitation. At the same time, Chinese firms are under increasing pressure to innovate. Therefore, we argue that forces of imitation and evaluation are likely both at play when Chinese firms adopt and assimilate innovations—including ERP. Accordingly, we examined how two behaviors, interorganizational social technology imitation and rational technology evaluation, influence Chinese organizations in adopting and assimilating ERP systems. Our findings suggest that both social technology imitation and rational technology evaluation are determinants of Chinese ERP adoption and assimilation. Hence, this study offers new ways for IT and innovation researchers to explore social behavior (i.e., imitation) in IT diffusion processes and to consider the merits or risks of such behavior alongside the conventional rational approach (i.e., evaluation).

            "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software offers a standardized platform for innovation that integrates financial and human resources, supply chain, and manufacturing functionality, but can be enhanced with customer relationship management, business intelligence, e-commerce, and more [37, 49]. Such functionality, if properly implemented, can significantly innovate firms not just through technical integration of information technology (IT) infrastructure but also through business integration of cross-functional and interorganizational business processes [66]. Though ERP has been shown to be essential to the success of medium to large business organizations, its sheer complexity has resulted in a high failure rate [30, 52]. Accordingly, innovation is never achieved by an off-the-shelf installation of ERP; rather, innovation with ERP requires integration and implementation that provides unique insights and competitive advantage. In China, ERP is particularly critical for strategic competitive advantage in its manufacturing firms and important for driving business intelligence and improving supply chain capabilities [30, 36]. However, effective ERP implementation is exceedingly difficult because it typically requires organizational transformation (e.g., business process engineering, change management) and strategic repositioning [78, 86]. Unfortunately, the failure rates of ERP in China have been higher than in Western countries [30, 101], leaving many opportunities for improvement. These high failure rates are largely due to the unique cultural and environmental context of Chinese firms. Compared to Western firms, Chinese firms have different styles of management, business models, and even data formats [10]. Other unique Chinese characteristics that influence ERP adoption are the strong role of government, the prominence of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) [10], and the variety of ownership structures—including SOEs [30]. Likewise, China has unique forms of corporate governance with a focus on guanxi, a term referring to a “strong emphasis\n",

            "on the relationships between business partners for achieving mutual benefits” [30, p. 502]. Differences in language, customer support practices, lack of professional personnel, organizational resistance, price expectations, and even reporting practices have also acted as barriers to Chinese ERP implementation. Chinese corporate culture can make it difficult to openly and honestly address organizational issues that need to be resolved so that proper reengineering of an organization can occur to achieve ERP implementation success [95, 98, 101]. Thus, it is clear that not all of the lessons learned from Western-based ERP implementations can simply be applied to a Chinese context [10, 30]. Some lessons may even be detrimental for Chinese firms because of poor cultural fit. Despite these issues, understanding and improving Chinese ERP implementation is compelling because of China’s economic size and technological position in the world. According to Martinsons, “More than any other country, China is being transformed by its application of IT, from a poor and isolated society to a major force in the global economy” [59, p. 46]. Therefore, China-specific ERP implementation knowledge is crucial to develop to foster ’s China’s impressive economic trajectory. Even successful ERP implementations in China have room for improvement. Many Chinese firms have implemented ERP but have not done so fully and thus have not achieved the promised benefits of the innovation [36, 104]. This issue demonstrates the differences between mere adoption of ERP and assimilation of ERP. Newman and Zhao state: “One of the major hurdles to successful ERP implementation is that many Chinese SMEs regard implementing ERP as a means to achieve modernization rather than to replace legacy systems and realize organizational change,” which requires process reengineering and assimilation of ERP [62, p. 406]. ERP assimilation is important to study because it is a better indicator of post-adoption success than mere implementation [52]. Lack of assimilation has been tied to organizations’ eventually failing, and sometimes removing, ERP implementations they initially thought to be successful [52]. Hence, one of our research goals is to understand the key factors that determine adoption and assimilation of ERP in China. In considering factors that predict adoption and assimilation in the literature, we found two potentially conflicting views regarding how this happens. One of these two methods of IT adoption and assimilation, technology evaluation, focuses on the rational evaluation of the objective characteristics of IT innovations that facilitate users’ beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. For example, diffusion of innovation’s evaluation of innovation characteristics along with the technology acceptance model’s evaluation of innovation’s perceived ease of use and usefulness offer crucial insights into the rational decisions of IT adoption and assimilation. But in reality, humans— including business executives and employees deploying ERP—demonstrate bounded rationality, which suggests that despite their intention to be rational, they simply cannot include all potential factors in decision making because of either the intrinsic constraints of the human brain or the extrinsic constraints of incomplete information [25]. To challenge the limitations of bounded rationality, humans observe how others behave and infer information from such behaviors. This leads to a set of literature on\n",

            "adoption and assimilation that focuses on imitation. Social imitation, a learning behavior of observing others facing similar decision scenarios, offers decision makers opportunities to transform, classify, organize, and draw inferences from observing the actions of others, thus conserving their resources and enhancing their chances of survival [63]. Organizations may be able to obtain new information from imitating other organizations [13, 41]. However, imitation comes in many forms, each of which affects the impact of decisions made in different organizational settings [12, 22]. Technology imitation is the investigation of different social mimetic forms that affect managerial perception and beliefs when adopting and assimilating IT innovations. These potentially conflicting views (i.e., evaluation versus imitation) of the drivers of adoption and assimilation are particularly meaningful in the context of implementing ERP in Chinese firms. To achieve world-leading growth in manufacturing and related industries, many Chinese companies adopted an imitation strategy [89]— including the use of ERP [10]. However, increasing national and industrial pressure has shifted companies’ methods toward evaluation, innovation, and external competition [15, 89]. Because of bounded rationality and its unique development trajectory and traditions, a typical Chinese company likely considers both imitation and evaluation to facilitate ERP implementation. We thus argue that the unique dynamics involved in ERP implementation require a carefully contextualized model that assumes imitation and evaluation as concurrent processes—not a dichotomous choice. Given this motivation, our study compares the approaches of technology evaluation and imitation to adoption and assimilation of ERP, as influenced by internal and external environments, in the China context. Specifically, we address two major research questions: 1. How do rational technology evaluation and social technology imitation influence the degree of ERP adoption and assimilation of Chinese firms implementing ERP? 2. How do external and internal forces (i.e., technological, organizational, and environmental characteristics) moderate the effects of technology imitation and evaluation on ERP adoption and assimilation of Chinese firms?\n",

Thus, our aim is not to propose hypotheses that explain how China is different from other national contexts.

The reason is that culture can differentiate people’s general behavior and organizations’ functioning [38, 100]. Although China is notably different from Western cultures in terms of norms regarding power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism/collectivism, and masculinity/femininity [38, 99], there are certain aspects of Chinese culture that differentially influence the adoption and assimilation of ERP products that originate from the West. These key factors include language, business practices and guanxi, Confucianism, and localization.\n",

Each of the Chinese characters is a pictographic symbol that represents an object or concept. These characters do not translate well to equivalent alphabetic symbols. For example, the homonyms (different symbols that sound the same, but have different meanings) and synonyms in Chinese characters can create translation and connotation problems while using ERP.1 In addition, most Chinese are still not well-versed in English; however, using leading ERP systems requires using English. Adopting or assimilating a vastly expensive ERP program that requires the use of a language in which a small percentage of Chinese executives and managers are fluent produces unique challenges in China.\n",

Market-based economies are governed by a universal set of formal rules and are regulated by free markets. In contrast, a state-controlled economy is a system in which the state makes economic decisions, which largely describes China [60], although there has been much privatization and sale of SOEs to private economic entities in recent decades [61]. Due to a lack of rule-based business practices (i.e., rule of law), Chinese companies have to rely on guanxi to conduct their business. Guanxi refers to a personal network or special relationship with mutual benefits [94] and determines how the Chinese do business and how their interpersonal and professional relationships work. For example, rigidly embedded ERP rules can conflict with the flexibility to override rules or procedures available in guanxi.\n",

These two philosophies drive organizations toward centralized and personal management rather than a decentralized and shared management style, which is an approach promoted by ERP. A key strategic goal of ERP use is to enhance communication, collaboration, and information sharing.

Chinese technology companies have developed world-class capabilities and yet have localized to China. These include software development (e.g., Kingdee, Kingsoft) and hardware manufacturing (e.g., Huawei, Xiaomi) to e-commerce (e.g, Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent). Consequently, the success of ERP vendors’ move into China depends to a great extent on how much their products and services have been intentionally localized to meet unique Chinese needs. In fact, localization of a product or service is challenging and many foreign IT companies (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Google) have failed in the Chinese market because they failed to follow local needs and requirements. In contrast, domestic Chinese ERP vendors took a major share of the market because they successfully integrated unique Chinese characteristics into their development of ERP systems [95].\n",

The selection of ERP adoption and assimilation as dependent variables allows us to evaluate and differentiate the longitudinal effects of technology evaluation and imitation strategies. We apply our evaluation from the pre-implementation stage of ERP adoption decisions to the post-implementation stage of ERP assimilation, thereby determining the degrees of ERP success. Our model is contextualized to large Chinese firms that have adopted or assimilated ERP. This contextualization is crucial because of the multiple characteristics of the Chinese context that uniquely affect imitation, evaluation, adoption, and assimilation. Many have argued that the best theory development in management fields (e.g., [24, 90, 91]) and IS (e.g., [8, 21]) is heavily contextualized as opposed to theory intended to apply to all situations. Aside from the boundary condition of being contextualized to China, our model is guided by some other key assumptions. First, we expect that in typical Chinese firms, evaluation and imitation are both used to some degree and do not reflect a dichotomy of choices. Second, the practices of\n",

            "Our research model is segmented into conceptual differences between ERP adoption and ERP assimilation. Per seminal research by Rogers, adoption refers to the acquisition, implementation, or purchase of an innovation [71]. According to Rogers, adoption is more about management authorizing purchase of technology or overseeing its basic implementation rather than more fully capturing strategic value for the firm by routinizing the technology for everyday use. The latter loosely refers to assimilation and is greatly preferred to adoption. Although there are several formal definitions of assimilation in the literature [27, 88, 102], all agree that assimilation essentially refers to the extent to which a firm has progressed through the stages of innovation deployment—from initial awareness to routinization (i.e., where the innovation has become an integral part of operation). Moreover, ERP is an especially complex technology to implement. Wei et al. [88] note that for such technologies with high implementation complexity, little or no actual assimilation occurs after technology adoption (i.e., the assimilation gap [28]). Many Chinese firms have implemented ERP but have not done so fully and thus have not achieved the innovation’s promised benefits. However, if assimilation is successful, the ERP innovation is infused and routinized into the work routines of an organization—providing its expected benefits [73]. These distinctions indicate why it is particularly important to compare and contrast adoption versus assimilation in an ERP context and why we provide contextualized and moderated hypotheses concerning both.\n",

We argue that a key reason Chinese firms find themselves stuck in the post-adoption phase or with suboptimal implementation is that they followed the processes of imitation too strongly and evaluation too weakly. Therefore, such firms could not achieve strategic assimilation, which requires in-depth rational evaluation, planning, and strategy (i.e., evaluation). Chinese firms can be especially prone to imitation when adopting ERP that is highly Westernized (i.e., not localized enough), which conflicts with language, business practices and guanxi, and\n",

However, another core assumption in our model is that imitation and evaluation are not dichotomous, and both are used in Chinese ERP implementations; however, imitation tends to lead to mere adoption, whereas evaluation is more likely to produce assimilation. We first provide evidence for treating imitation and evaluation as nondichotomous. The importance of technology imitation and evaluation varies according to the innovations under consideration. However, research has found that the effects of such behaviors can be simultaneous and tend to converge over time [87, 97]. Thus, social imitation can complement rather than compete against rational behavior, thereby leading to better ERP decisions [87].2 In fact, the extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) model to include social influence is an attempt by rational information systems (IS) theorists to examine a wider range of factors drawn from both the social and rational perspectives. Similarly, theorists of imitation do not exclude objective rationality [22].\n",
            "\n",
            "How Organizational Imitation Works Interdisciplinary researchers have applied various theories to explain imitative behavior.3 In IS, most organizational imitation studies have taken an institutional perspective. Here, organizations are compelled to respond to the constraints within their respective environments for the sake of survival, which results in the elimination of less optimal organizational and in a high level of resemblance among the remaining organizations [34]. With this perspective, IS researchers have investigated the effect of institutional pressures on ERP adoption [52, 73], and others examined the effects of diffusion of innovation (DOI) and imitation on the organizational beliefs involved in the adoption of ERP systems. Regardless, we argue that when imitation is the primary driver for ERP implementation, projects are more likely to involve less strategic thinking and lack deep stakeholder involvement in implementing ERP itself. Such an approach fosters adoption but blunts the ability of a firm to truly assimilate ERP because it does not understand itself, its supply chain, its competitors, and the technology itself to achieve strategic assimilation. Likewise, imitation used in conjunction with evaluation is more likely to lead to ERP implementation success.\n",

The adoption perspective evaluates the organizational characteristics that make the IT receptive to innovation and change and thus for initial adoption of an innovation, whereas the diffusion perspective investigates the innovation characteristics that lead to the IT’s widespread acceptance and assimilation [65]. According to DOI theory, technological characteristics are critical for successful innovation adoption and ultimate diffusion. Among all of the innovation characteristics investigated thus far, compatibility, relative advantage, complexity, trialability, and observability have been found to be the most important. Our investigation, however, focuses only on relative advantage, complexity, and compatibility because these three characteristics have consistently been found to be significant for innovation assimilation in a meta-analysis of previous work on innovation characteristics [82].4 Firms that use a logical evaluation perspective, as manifested in these three DOI constructs, are much more likely to end up with successful ERP assimilation rather than mere adoption. But again, we believe most Chinese firms combine the social influence of imitation with the bounded rationality of evaluation.\n",

            "The Direct Effects of Imitation and Evaluation Behavior Studies of rational DOI and TAM (e.g., [20, 71, 84]) have confirmed the importance of technology evaluation in effecting an innovation’s consequential adoption. This is also evident in the context of Chinese businesses [47]. A wide range of characteristics including relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness is influential in the decision-making process of innovation adoption. Yet, these technology characteristics have to be localized to Chinese business operations and culture. Institutional and herding theorists (e.g., [5, 7, 22, 70]) have also shown that a critical mass of users can, over time, create positive bandwagon effects for others to follow, including the decision to adopt ERP. This phenomenon is prominent in China, where large and successful organizations are highly influential, thus creating a potentially strong bandwagon effect [49]. In comparing the behavior of evaluators and social imitators, theories of evaluation (such as DOI and TAM) have confirmed that organizations that perform technology evaluation are much larger (e.g., more resources, employees, or revenue) and more innovative, and industry leaders have better technological capability; this holds in China [47]. Thus, these organizations are more aware of ERP benefits and its strategic values. In contrast, imitating organizations, as suggested by theorists of organizational sociology, are generally less prestigious, less successful, less resourceful, and smaller, thus constraining their scale of ERP adoption. When imitators are unaware of their ERP needs and are restricted in their resources, their adoption scale\n",

Such trade-offs between evaluation and imitation have long been a key controversy in the Chinese context. In a rapidly developing country, many Chinese companies have adopted an imitation strategy to attain superiority in manufacturing and related industries [89] including the use of ERP [10]. Imitation gave these companies a jumpstart in ERP use but did not guarantee strategic ERP benefits. Again, one likely cause of this hurdle is a lack of localization of the ERP to the unique cultural needs of Chinese companies especially in terms of language, business practices and guanxi, and Confucianism. Hence, when ERP progresses to maturity, organizations are increasingly pressured toward evaluation, innovation, and external competition [15, 89] for organizational performance. Thus, in China: Hypothesis 1: Technology imitation and evaluation both have a positive effect on ERP adoption (a), but the effect of technology evaluation is stronger than that of technology imitation (b).\n",

            "The Moderating Effect of Technology Readiness Organizations with greater technology readiness are in a better position to adopt advanced IT innovations [103] primarily through embeddedness mechanisms [83]; such organizations have better technologies and more competent IT professionals to deal with the issues associated with ERP decisions. Research has shown that Chinese firms with stronger technology readiness tend to achieve greater post-implementation success with ERP [104]. Such readiness in our context is about not only technological know-how but also cultural fit with the ERP product and vendor such that the innovation can be more readily assimilated. However, with less technology readiness, organizations cannot make decisions about ERP and need to follow their competitors’ practices. A unique way that Chinese firms have dealt with this lack of readiness is through imitation. Imitating their competitors gives firms a second-mover advantage of unexpected or unsought unique benefits including the accrual of an external referent of prestige [49]. These unexpected benefits, along with the expected benefits of lower adoption risks and costs, could favorably compensate IT inadequacy in ERP evaluation. This kind of imitation was largely necessary for Chinese firms to catch up with (and eventually surpass) the manufacturing and industrial capabilities of Western firms [10, 15]—often creating a technological “leapfrogging effect.” Thus, in China: Hypothesis 2: When technology readiness is high, the effect of technology evaluation on ERP adoption is stronger than that of technology imitation (a); however, when technology readiness is low, the effect of technology imitation on ERP adoption is stronger than that of technology evaluation (b).\n",

            "The Moderating Effect of Top Management’s ERP Belief Belief has been an underlying theme among many popular rational IT models (such as TAM and TPB) with a general consensus that it has a critical impact on IT adoption and intention to use [14, 20]. Belief about an ERP is the subjective psychological state of evaluation regarding its potential to benefit the organization. This belief is developed after the collection, processing, and synthesis of information [51]. In China, ERP implementations are normally initiated by top management [58], ostensibly because of their belief in ERP. These senior executives—as influenced by the privatization and joint-venture policies in modernizing Chinese businesses [61, 76]—are less susceptible to principles of Confucianism but more inclined to make their business decisions decentralized, formalized, and transparent. ERP’s capability and capacity in supporting collaboration, formalism, and best business practices are effective in enhancing belief in the innovation. As such, the extent of ERP belief of top management will determine the level of their determination to move the project forward. These findings are particularly applicable to ERP adoption and assimilation in China [52] especially as ERP failures are an embarrassment that can undermine organizations’ hierarchical authoritarianism. ERP must also not be seen as a threat to time-honored business practices and guanxi. Hence, when top Chinese managers believe strongly in ERP, they are more likely to commit to and ensure success of ERP initiatives. Although social influence theorists have observed a positive correlation between social imitation and beliefs, little research has explored the relationship between management belief, social imitation, and IT adoption. Through imitation, private information is gained from the actions of others [7]. Thus, social imitation can translate the practices of others into terms that are meaningful and useful to management’s internal ERP decisions as seen in China [49]. Thus, we suggest that in China when top management’s belief in ERP is low, technology imitation affects ERP adoption decisions more than technology evaluation does. We propose: Hypothesis 3: When top management’s ERP belief is high, the effect of technology evaluation on ERP adoption is stronger than that of technology imitation (a); however, when top management’s ERP belief is low, the effect of technology imitation on ERP adoption is stronger than that of technology evaluation (b).\n",

            "The Moderating Effect of Environmental Uncertainty Environmental uncertainty often encourages organizations to imitate others instead of using technical rules to evaluate alternatives [35, 53]. Environmental uncertainty also slows the rational decision-making process and has a negative impact on performance, thus having little influence on ERP decisions. When uncertainty is high, organizations’ leaders are persuaded to model themselves on others and to base their ERP adoption decisions on social comparison. This correlation between uncertainty and imitation may motivate organizations to adopt ERP systems while changing few of the ERP parameters that need to be altered to fit their organization’s needs. Liang et al. aptly explain that mimetic forces or pressure “results as\n",

            "organizations respond to uncertainty by mimicking actions of other organizations. When technologies are poorly understood, when goals are ambiguous, or when the environment creates uncertainty, organizations may model themselves after other organizations perceived to be legitimate or successful” [52, p. 62]. Crucially, they confirm this relationship in a Chinese ERP assimilation context. Further research shows that Chinese firms are especially prone to mimetic pressure with increased environmental uncertainty or instability [96]. If this holds, it then follows that when environmental uncertainty is low, Chinese organizations are more assured of the effective application of ERP in implementing their chosen strategies. They will tend to sense the means–ends relationship between ERP initiatives and ERP assimilation. The managers are also more certain of the outcomes of ERP initiatives, which motivates them to adopt more ERP modules for effective ERP implementation. Thus, at times of low uncertainty, technology evaluation, rather than technology imitation, is a more effective approach to the design of appropriate strategies for ERP adoption. Such an approach helps to ensure more ERP adoption and more capacity to reap the benefits of ERP systems. Thus, in China: Hypothesis 4: When environmental uncertainty is high, the effect of technology imitation on ERP adoption is stronger than that of technology evaluation (a); however, when environmental uncertainty is low, the effect of technology evaluation on ERP adoption is stronger than that of technology imitation (b).\n",

            "The Moderating Effect of Competition Intensity Competition intensity is the degree of competitive strength among players within an industry. In China, Confucianism encourages competition for organizational social status, resources, and performance [6]. However, intense competition can lead to the use of homogeneous strategies in an effort to neutralize the aggressive actions of rivals [53] by matching the behavior of their competitors. Moreover, when competition is intense, organizations have more pressure and less time to evaluate ERP in response to current challenges. This coercive competitive pressure within an industry forces organizations to imitate leading competitors, making them less likely to execute evaluation decisions [22]. Thus, technology imitation may become more influential in ERP adoption at times of intense competition, and it may reverse when competition intensity is low. These general principles should apply in a Chinese context to the extent that a given industry faces intense competition. As evidenced in the highly competitive market of electronic commerce in China, online companies are very responsive to their competitors’ strategies as they imitate successful methods immediately to avoid falling behind. This phenomenon is not as obvious in lesscompetitive industries such as manufacturing. In China, most large firms are not exposed to high levels of intense industry competition, especially SOEs that are shielded from internal and external competition [36, 89]. They have less pressure\n",

            "ERP Assimilation in Terms of Imitation and Evaluation\n",
            "The Direct Effects of Imitation and Evaluation Behavior Technology evaluation and imitation may have differential effects on the lengthy process of ERP assimilation. Technology evaluation gives organizations a better understanding of ERP and its fit to business operations, thereby directing learning and adaptation processes toward successful institutionalization. Technology evaluation also enables organizations to effectively chart an assimilation strategy to capitalize on ERP’s potential contributions to streamlined business practices and the integration of organizational data [79]. These effects of technology evaluation are particularly crucial in China as popular ERP systems are developed primarily in the West. During the ERP adoption stage, Chinese organizations may be more constrained by ERP in their business activities. However, as ERP is assimilated over time, Chinese organizations’ ERP knowledge accumulated from adoption and assimilation evaluation allows them to develop useful ERP integration solutions, thus localizing ERP to their business practice, local culture, and language needs. Imitation, by contrast, may be influential in the initial ERP decision, after which the organization learns from its own and others’ experience [53]. Thus, organizations may also imitate adoption decisions when learning to build their own capacity for ERP utilization. Yet time lags and relative learning rates may affect the learning dynamics of imitators, thus resulting in low-quality ERP assimilation. These effects of learning and performance have already been demonstrated by empirical findings in other contexts (e.g., [17]). We propose that this is especially true in an ERP context because the “best practices” embedded in an off-the-shelf implementation of ERP are unlikely to satisfy all users [52]. The fit of these “best practices”—in both management mindset and organizational behaviors—to Chinese firms justifies thorough evaluation. Such assessment is important because China has very unique technological, organizational, cultural, industrial, and legal requirements, which makes standard implementation of Western-based ERP technologies especially challenging [10]. Implementing most off-the-shelf ERP “best practices” based on Western industries will clash with language, culture, and established business practices in China. Thus, in China: Hypothesis 6: Technology evaluation and imitation both have a positive effect on ERP assimilation (a), but the effect of technology evaluation is stronger than that of technology imitation (b).\n",

            "The Moderating Effect of Top Management Participation Top management belief and participation are not the same; belief leads to participation, but does not guarantee it [52]. Hence, participation is more crucial, and this is especially true in China where management has outsized influence, in contrast to Western firms. The reason for this is that respect for seniors and authority has always been a core belief of Confucianism [11]. Accordingly, organizational employees are expected to comply unquestioningly with the instructions of senior management. Top management participation refers to senior executives’ behavior related to institutional planning, development, and implementation [44]. This participative behavior is essential in the assimilation stage because it is needed to plan efficient IT processes and strategically assimilate the targeted IT [4]. Top management participation can also help to coordinate and resolve conflicts among individuals and functions in the assimilation process [39]. In China, when top management is actively involved in ERP assimilation, organizations become more conscious of ERP’s goals, thus enabling more organizational alignment [52]. Given the unique challenges of China ERP implementation, research has shown that top management support is crucial throughout an ERP project and for successful implementation of the innovation [30, 36, 104]. Likewise, a reduction in top management participation should lead to less effective ERP leadership. Subsequently, organizations may be less able to integrate an ERP infrastructure that is beneficial to long-term competitiveness, or they may invest in ERP as an act of faith [52], leading to resistance or devising work-arounds such as the use of shadow systems [78]. Without top management participation, organizations are likely to be less visionary, less coordinated, and less committed to ERP assimilation; they are thus more likely to imitate or be influenced by their trading partners or competitors to institutionalize their ERP. Previous Chinese ERP implementation studies have shown that when top managers delegate their ERP involvement to lower-level managers, it sends negative signals about the implementation that undermine long-term post-implementation success [62, 67]. Thus, in China: Hypothesis 7: When top management participation is high, the effect of technology evaluation on ERP assimilation is stronger than that of technology imitation (a); however, when top management participation is low, the effect of technology imitation is stronger than that of technology evaluation (b).\n",
            "\n",
            "The Moderating Effect of Vendor Involvement In China, having an implementation partner is just as crucial as top management participation [10]. The effectiveness of vendor involvement in transferring knowledge is essential to the success of ERP assimilation, especially because extra challenges are introduced when implementing Western-developed ERP packages in the unique cultural environment of China [10, 30]. When vendors assume more responsibilities and become more involved in planning and strategic tasks, their influence on assimilation is more extensive and effective [80]. Such vendors are\n",

Vendors are also helpful in reconciling the differences in built-in Chinese and ERP business practices along with the variations of language use in ERP and business operation. Thus, with a high level of vendor involvement, organizations are more motivated and able to rationally evaluate ERP systems and practices, which leads to more effective ERP assimilation. However, the literature is not clear about how vendor involvement moderates the impact of social imitation on ERP assimilation. Nonetheless, agency theory suggests that when the involvement of a vendor (as an agent) is low, knowledge asymmetry between vendor and organization in ERP assimilation continues, thus forcing Chinese organizations to exploit ERP by engaging in learning-by-imitating for an optimal assimilation solution [49]. Thus, we propose that in China, weak vendor involvement encourages technology imitation and discourages technology evaluation: Hypothesis 8: When vendor involvement is high, the effect of technology evaluation on ERP assimilation is stronger than that of technology imitation (a); however, when vendor involvement is low, the effect of technology imitation is stronger than that of technology evaluation (b).\n",

            "The Moderating Effect of Organizational Innovativeness In the past few decades, China has been active in joint ventures with multinational corporations, privatizing SOEs, and establishing innovative high-tech regions. These national strategies offer opportunities for Chinese organizations to be exposed to leading technologies and modern management, thus allowing for more innovation. Innovative organizations are, in general, larger and more open with norms that encourage change [71]. They also have more slack resources and absorptive capacity and thus more time and resources for the scanning, experimenting, and learning involved in adopting ERP systems [73]. The better learning capabilities of innovative organizations avow them more opportunity to achieve the organizational transformations facilitated by ERP. These transformations include alignment of the much-touted best practices of the respective ERP systems with an organization’s existing practices and the transformation of an organization’s existing IT infrastructure and data architecture to the ERP platform. Innovative organizations are also more likely to implement a centralized support unit to guide and coordinate their ERP initiatives [64]. Thus, we propose that the most innovative organizations are more proactive and have more resources to create effective evaluation strategies for ERP adoption. However, some Chinese organizations are more traditional and more susceptible to the influence of Confucianism. These organizations place a greater emphasis on social and cosmic harmony, which leads to more social conformity and less innovation [19]. When organizations are less innovative, they are more likely to follow an imitation route, as shown extensively in China [10, 15, 47]. Such firms also tend to\n",

As such, these organizations have fewer strategic reasons for adopting ERP systems other than to follow their competitors. Innovative firms in China can best be represented by joint ventures, whereas less innovative firms are often conservative SOEs. Joint ventures tend to set up a cross-functional steering committee to achieve a consensus on strategies for ERP assimilation. In contrast, the assimilation strategies of SOEs are designated to individuals’ responsibility [58]. Thus, with more organizational innovation, the effects of evaluation are more expected, whereas with less organizational innovativeness, the effects of imitation on ERP adoption are probably more consequential. Thus, we propose: Hypothesis 9: When organizational innovation is high, the effect of technology evaluation on ERP assimilation is stronger than that of technology imitation (a); when organizational innovation is low, the effect of technology imitation is stronger than that of technology evaluation (b).\n",

Because the ERP committee members were responsible for making ERP adoption decisions and devising strategies for its implementation, they could also describe their organization’s perspective on IT innovation.

Our study fulfills all eight of these criteria, thus justifying our cross-sectional data collection.

[37] and adapted by Ranganathan and Brown [66]. ERP adoption in the present study is classified into four levels according to its use in value-chain modules (materials management, operations, sales and distribution, supply chain management, and customer services) and enterprise-support modules (finance, human resources, and data warehouse). An organization was classified as a level-1 implementer if it had adopted only enterprise-support modules, a level-2 implementer if it had adopted one value-chain module (with or without enterprise-support modules), a level-3 implementer if it had adopted two or three value-chain modules (with or without enterprise-support modules), and a level-4 implementer if it had adopted a full suite or a selected suite of four value-chain modules. Nonadopters were assigned a zero. This classification is a comprehensive measure because it captures two essential characteristics of ERP adoption—width (coverage of supply chain activities) and depth (the total number of modules). The interviewees were instructed to indicate whether their company’s ERP modules had been adopted at the initial implementation stage or were the same as those they were using at the time of our survey regardless of whether the modules were routinized after adoption. The scale of ERP assimilation was adapted from Liang et al. [52] and was composed of three items to measure volume, diversity, and depth of assimilation. The volume dimension was measured by the percentage of the firm’s business processes that used the ERP system. The diversity dimension was assessed by the number of the firm’s business functions that were automated by the ERP system. The depth dimension was measured by the vertical effect of the ERP system on the firm’s business activities, ranging from ongoing planning to strategic decision making. The interviewees were asked to respond to those survey questions based on the situation at the time of the survey. Specified as a second-order formative construct, the measure of ERP imitation, developed by Hauschild and Miner [35], was subdivided into three organizational modes designed to measure frequency-, trait-, and outcomes-based imitation. Accordingly, it was specified as a second-order formative construct with these three modes as its subdimensions. The ERP evaluation measure was based on the evaluation results of the three DOI dimensions—relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity. It was treated as a second-order formative construct composed of these three components.8 The measures of technology readiness were adapted from Zhu et al. [103]. Top management belief and management participation were measured by top management’s perceived value of ERP in business activities and their participation in managing the ERP initiative.

Vendor involvement was the extent of a vendor ’s investment in the relationship with the organization, the business process restructuring that was undertaken to fit the relationship requirements, and the establishment of an implementation team [18, 72]. To help test counter-explanations to our model, we used five control variables: industry type, ownership type, firm age, firm size, and time since ERP adoption. Industry type was classified by sector (e.g., finance, manufacturing, IT, insurance, and health). These industries face different sets of circumstances and industry competition, and are thus likely to have differential effects on ERP assimilation [93]. Ownership type was categorized as SOE, domestic-private-owned, joint-venture, or solely foreign-invested. In China, ownership type is likely to differ in innovativeness. For example, SOEs are more prone to maintaining bureaucratic procedures, whereas joint ventures are more inclined to innovation. A domestic enterprise may lack the necessary skills to conduct systematic reviews of its ERP system, whereas a foreign enterprise may be more likely to acquire the skill set through their mother company. Firm age was measured by the natural logarithm of the number of years of business operation, and the natural log transformation was used to account for the diminishing effects of firm age. In general, new organizations tend to be more flexible in introducing new technologies; thus, the organization’s age can also affect technology assimilation [34]. Firm size, as a formative variable, was measured by the affiliate’s annual sales and number of employees. This variable has been validated in prior studies to have differential effects on ERP business process outcomes in process efficiency, effectiveness, and flexibility, thus resulting in ERP implementation benefits in different ways [57].

In addition, we examined whether the moderations were sensitive to the nonlinear effects of the predictors on each criterion by controlling for the squared effects of the predictors (imitation and DOI). The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3. To confirm the hypotheses, we split the sample into a series of two subsamples by the proposed moderator ’s mean value. We used the approach in Aiken and West [2] to define a moderator ’s high and low level as one standard deviation above or below the mean. Regressions were run on the subsamples. Then, t-tests and Smith– Satterthwaite (S–S) tests [23] were applied to compare the path coefficients of the two subsamples. The results of these two tests are reported in Tables 4 and 5.\n",

            "respectively, suggested that these moderation effects were of medium size. We also conducted an F-test for the significance of the incremental R2. The resultant F-values for these two moderation effects were significant (F = 6.513 and 8.145; p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively), indicating that the incremental R2 (ΔR2) explained by these two moderation effects on ERP adoption was significant. The ΔR2 for the moderation effects of top management belief (F = 0.341, n.s.) and competitive intensity (F = 0.341, n.s.) were not significant. The main effects of both imitation and DOI were significant for ERP adoption (β = 0.135 and 0.112; p < 0.05), but these effects showed no significant difference in magnitude (t = 1.086, n.s; see Table 4). Thus, H1 is only partially supported. For the moderation effect of technology readiness, our results (shown in Table 2) suggested that it was a significant moderator for the effects of both DOI and imitation on ERP adoption (β = –0.182 and 0.268, respectively; p < 0.01). Further analysis of these relationships showed that when the levels of technology readiness varied, the effects of imitation and DOI on adoption exhibited very different patterns. As shown in Table 4, when the level of technology readiness was low, imitation had a stronger effect than DOI on ERP adoption (t = 8.153; p < 0.01) and the effect of DOI on adoption was not significant (β = 0.069, n.s.). By contrast, when the level of technology readiness was high, DOI had a stronger effect than imitation (t = –2.681; p < 0.05). Thus, H2 is supported. Top management belief did not show any significant variation in its moderating effect between imitation and DOI for ERP adoption (β = 0.017 and 0.049, n.s. See Table 2, Model 5; t =1.213, s-s = 1.322, n.s. and t = –1.154, s–s = –1.306, n.s. for imitation and DOI, respectively; see Table 4). Regardless of whether top management belief is high or low, the effects of imitation and DOI on adoption showed no significant difference (t = 0.561 and 1.091, n.s.; see Table 4). These findings suggest H3 is not supported. Environmental uncertainty did change the relative positions of imitation and DOI in adoption. Although imitation had the same effect on adoption at different levels of environmental uncertainty (t = –0.088, s–s = –0.137, n.s.), the effect of DOI was significantly higher when uncertainty was low (t = 8.663, s–s = 9,712, p < 0.01). When uncertainty was low, DOI had a significantly stronger impact on adoption than imitation (β = 0.276, p < 0.01 and 0.144, p < 0.05, respectively; t = –4.541, p < 0.01). By contrast, when uncertainty was high, imitation had a stronger impact (β = 0.149, p < 0.05) than DOI (t = 2.892, p < 0.05) and the effect of DOI was not significant (β = 0.051, n.s.). Thus, H4 is supported. Competitive intensity demonstrated the same moderating patterns as top management belief. It did not change the effects of imitation and DOI on adoption (β = –0.018 and 0.052, n.s.; see Table 2, Model 9; t = 0.091, s–s = 1.004, n.s. and t = –0.082, s–s = –1.076, n.s. for imitation and DOI, respectively; see Table 4).

            "The results for the MRA models are reported in Table 3. The F-test for ΔR2 indicated that the top management participation moderation effect was not significant (F = 1.665, p = 0.191), while the moderation effects of vendor involvement and organizational innovativeness on assimilation were significant (F = 12.636 and 9.424, p = 0.000 and 0.000, respectively). The Cohen f2 of 0.091 and 0.058 suggested a small effect size for the moderation effects of vendor involvement moderation and organizational innovativeness. However, in dealing with such complex interaction terms, a small effect is considered highly meaningful [16]. Similar to adoption, both imitation and DOI had significant effects on ERP assimilation (β = 0.121 and 0.117, p < 0.05), but these effects showed no significant difference in magnitude (t = 0.122, n.s.; see Table 5). Thus, H6 is only partially supported. Top management participation did not influence the effects of imitation and DOI on assimilation (t = –0.915, s–s = –0.996, n.s. and t = 0.082, s–s = 0.103, n.s. for imitation and DOI, respectively; see Table 5). In addition, regardless of whether top management participation was high or low, the effects of imitation and DOI on assimilation showed no significant difference in magnitude (t = 0.051 and 0.203, n. s.; see Table 5). These findings suggest that H7 is not supported. By contrast, vendor involvement significantly changed the patterns of the effects of imitation and DOI on assimilation. Although the effect of imitation on assimilation did not significantly change when vendor involvement shifted from low to high (t = –0.093, s–s = –0.106, n.s.), the effect of DOI on assimilation was significantly augmented (t = –9.763, s–s = 10.152, p < 0.01). In addition, when vendor involvement varied, so did the relative strength of imitation and DOI. When vendor involvement was low, imitation had a stronger effect on assimilation than DOI (t = 2.185, p < 0.05). However, when vendor involvement was high, DOI had a stronger effect than imitation (t = –3.165, p < 0.05; see Table 5). These results suggest that H8 is supported. A comparison of the moderating effects of innovativeness on the relationships between DOI, imitation, and ERP assimilation (as shown in Table 3, Model 7) confirmed that the effects of DOI and imitation were not significantly different for less innovative companies (t = –1.056, n.s.; see Table 5). However, for highly innovative companies, the effect of DOI was significantly higher than that of imitation for ERP adoption (t = –4.363, p < 0.01). Thus, H9 is partially supported.\n",

            "Explaining the Contributions of Contrary Results in a China Context\n",
            "Although most of our hypotheses are supported, several turned out contrary to our predictions. Certain factors of the China context may have affected these outcomes in ways we did not previously expect. First, to rapidly develop as a world power, China has commonly followed an imitation, “leapfrog” approach in manufacturing and industrial processes, which has resulted in late adoption of ERP. However, this “leapfrog” approach has been challenging in ERP because of technological and cultural barriers, including with major Western providers such as SAP and Oracle [10], whose products are not fully localized to China. More recently, Chinese firms have experienced more ERP implementation success as Chinese firms have gained technological and external expertise [10, 52]. Hence, it is not entirely surprising to find that there is no statistical difference between imitation and evaluation drivers on adoption and assimilation (H1b not supported) because imitation has had a strong influence on ERP adoption and diffusion in China, and many of China’s current industries continue to embrace this mindset. Another likely explanation for several other contrary results is that a large portion of the firms we studied were SOEs or similarly protected firms, which have some\n",

            "unique, important characteristics that affect our context. First, these are often highly bureaucratic and inefficient firms that are largely protected not only by foreign but also domestic competition despite intense reforms over the years [36, 54, 89]. In fact, some SOEs have simply become larger by absorbing less successful SOEs that have failed in required reforms. Second, many of these firms are prone to practices of guanxi, favoritism, corruption, and even instances of management positions being given out or retained as favors [42]. As a result, some managers in SOEs often lack the competence, knowledge, and training of their Western counterparts [42] and tend to lack incentives for innovation [36], especially because sometimes the government does not favor improvement if jobs will be lost in their sectors [62]. Third, such firms tend to have worse innovation infrastructure and more poorly trained workers as compared to establishments in private industry [10, 89]. Fourth, managers at SOEs tend to have an authoritarian, command-and-control decision-making style (and workers tend to have a duty and obedience style) [54], which conflicts with the management style typically needed for ERP implementation [62]. Research provides evidence that more Western types of management (e.g., consensus-building, empowerment) are critical for successful ERP implementation and that the common practice of delegating implementation of ERP to lower managers undermines implementation success [62, 67]. Juxtaposed to this added understanding of the China context, we found that top management’s ERP belief and top management’s ERP participation had no positive role in our model (H3 and H7, respectively, not supported). Hence, because most of our respondents were either from SOEs or large firms that experience some form of protection, they most likely employed a hierarchical administration structure. Top managers in these companies tend to control rather than supervise ERP projects. They are commonly reluctant to be directly involved in their company’s projects or in resolving ERP implementation issues [58, 67]. Management’s relative inexperience with the automation and standardization that comes with ERP also restricts their ability to differentiate between the merits of evaluation and imitation approaches to ERP assimilation. Likewise, the level of industry competitiveness had no bearing on the outcomes (H5 not supported). We attribute these findings to the general lack of competition found in SOEs and other large firms in China. To a certain extent, China’s economy is still state-controlled, which probably reduces management incentive to deploy effective strategies to ease competition pressure. This finding coincides with the claim that competition can create implicit incentives to stimulate efficiency [55], suggesting that when competition is reduced owing to a state-controlled economy, organizations’ incentives for efficiency are also reduced. As a consequence of this competition–incentive relationship, organizations may be less discriminative in the use of imitation or evaluation for their ERP adoption decisions. Moreover, even highly trained and competent SOE managers naturally have little incentive to deploy strategic initiatives to improve their firms’ performance [36] because they work in protected industries with monopolistic traits and virtually no competition.9\n",

            "Key Contributions and Implications for Research\n",
            "Our research provides an important contextualized model of Chinese ERP implementation that predicts factors that lead to adoption or assimilation. Aside from examining both of these dependent variables, a compelling aspect of our study is that we do not treat technological imitation or evaluation as a dichotomous choice that fosters either adoption or assimilation. Instead, we argue that in a China context, it makes sense to assume that both processes are at play (as China was a late entrant into ERP adoption) and therefore that it is crucial to empirically evaluate how technology imitation and evaluation complement each other and where these processes differ. Our results suggest that technology imitation and technology evaluation practices have crucial effects on the extent of ERP adoption and assimilation in China. Both imitation and evaluation act as direct effects, but they are also moderated by several key TOE factors. Although extant studies have addressed how imitation and evaluation influence ERP adoption and assimilation, they have focused only on either imitation or on evaluation (e.g., [20, 71]) alone. Consequently, Tingling and Parent asked, “Does imitation transcend judgment?” and pointed out that “Further research is warranted to investigate the presence and extent of these effects” [81, p. 113]. Our study has also addressed this research need in the unique context of unique Chinese business. As a result, uniting these perspectives contributes to our understanding of standalone and integrative effects of imitation and evaluation—along with their subsequent effects as moderated by internal and external influences—on IT adoption and assimilation. The insights derived from this investigation should allow IT professionals to develop more effective strategies for infusing Chinese organizations with new innovations. This study also offers new ways for IT researchers to explore social behavior (i.e., imitation) in IT diffusion processes and to consider the merits or risks of such behavior alongside the conventional rational approach (i.e., evaluation). We further explain these contributions using two criteria—their ability to predict ERP adoption and assimilation and the value of the information provided. Regarding predictability, technology imitation and evaluation are both useful in explaining ERP adoption and assimilation, and the variance explained by technology evaluation is also similar to that explained by technology imitation. In terms of the value of information, technology evaluation supplies specific information on ERP’s technological performance, whereas technology imitation offers general information on adopters’ social behavior. Given the findings that technology imitation and\n",

            "evaluation are equally important in predicting ERP adoption and assimilation, the selection of an imitation or evaluation approach in ERP decisions is based on an organization’s internal technological and management characteristics and the external environment in which it operates. Another implication of this study is related to the relative weights of technology imitation and evaluation approaches in influencing ERP adoption and assimilation. Tingling and Parent [81] called for further studies on how relative weights and values are assigned to each of the criteria for imitation and evaluation. In our study, we examine the relative weights of imitation and evaluation approaches under various contingencies such as uncertainty, competition, experience, and innovativeness—yielding important institutional insights and new explanations for IT innovation diffusion. Finally, our findings contribute to both ERP and innovation research. Specific to ERP research, our study provides empirical evidence on how ERP is diffused in China. Our evaluation of the social force of imitation and rational force of evaluation provides support to their criticality in influencing the extent of ERP adoption and assimilation among Chinese organizations. These findings may suggest to ERP vendors how to localize ERP implementation and marketing strategies in the China market taking into consideration the effect of technological, organizational, and environmental variations. In terms of innovation research, our study applies a dual perspective of social imitation and rational evaluation, which has seldom been applied in a single investigation, to evaluate their differential effects at different stages of IT diffusion. Our findings suggest that the past emphasis on one single perspective of rational evaluation may be biased toward formalism and rationalism. In reality, innovation adoption could be less rational and more socially oriented. Hence, innovation research should be more encompassing in its perspective to avoid overlooking any possibility that explains the variations of ERP adoption and assimilation. Moreover, this study represents one of the few innovation studies involving China ERP innovation, which provides sorely needed contextual contributions in the literature.\n",

            "The findings of our research also have several important implications for managerial practice. First, this study provides strong evidence that both technology imitation and evaluation are important forces for ERP adoption and assimilation in China. Therefore, decisions regarding ERP implementation should consider both imitation and evaluation—not just one factor. ERP vendors can promote their systems either by imitation- or value-based strategies—or a combination of the two. Using an imitation-based strategy, ERP vendors may encourage potential users to implement ERP because a large number of high-status organizations have done so with success. Using a value-based strategy, ERP vendors may promote their systems based on\n",

            "technical values such as task–technology fit, perceived ease of use, and perceived overall usefulness. Moreover, our findings suggest that both technology imitation and evaluation are subject to environmental and organizational influences. Thus, ERP vendors should segment their markets by business environment and innovativeness, and different promotion strategies should be used for different market segments. For example, for potential users with low technology readiness, who solicit less vendor participation and/or who operate in highly uncertain environments, an imitation-based strategy may be more effective. By contrast, for potential users with high technology readiness, who are innovative, solicit more vendor participation, and/or operate in stable environments, a merit-based strategy may be more effective. Another implication of our research stems from the strong support we found in vendor involvement and not in management participation for moderating the effects of imitation or evaluation approaches on ERP assimilation. One implication of this is that once ERP has been implemented and routinized, top management becomes less involved in key decisions (such as the use of an imitation or evaluation approach) because their participation can be replaced by external IT expertise. Although it is true that top management need not be actively involved throughout the ERP assimilation process, it is also true that relying on external expertise can be risky. This is not a strategically wise position to take even though it appears common in China. Thus, top management participation is still required for key decisions regarding ERP assimilation into business operations and conflict resolution involving cross-functional ERP infusion and routinization. Top management can also work with vendors to initiate strategies and practices for successful ERP assimilation. To move toward greater technological leapfrogging and worldwide economic leadership, it is imperative that executives in China become better trained and involved in ERP deployment. Finally, we argue that managers need to carefully consider key moderating variables in their strategic decisions on ERP adoption and assimilation. By considering environmental uncertainty and competitive pressures, managers can gain insights into how to devise best-fit strategies for their decisions on ERP adoption and assimilation. By being more aware of their organization’s IT infrastructure, innovativeness, and management characteristics, managers can better decide on a technology adoption approach that fits their organizational culture. This is especially pertinent because of the wide variety of organizational forms in China. Whereas some firms are largely protected from competition, others operate in a highly competitive market. Thus, in China, “one size does not fit all,” which will become especially true as SOEs further privatize and reform.\n",

            "that we strongly encourage. First, we modeled imitation generally. However, different types of imitation (i.e., frequency-, trait-, and outcome-based) may have different effects on ERP adoption and assimilation. Because the moderation effects of environmental and organizational conditions on these different types of imitation may be complex, future research is needed to study this. Second, we adopted a cross-sectional approach to data collection, which is excellent for maximizing external validity but suffers weaknesses in claiming internal or causal validity. In such an organizational context, experimentation is an unrealistic solution to this dilemma; however, longitudinal data can be very helpful albeit difficult to successfully collect. For example, data collected at several time points, using two-phase data collection, where adoption-related data are collected in the first phase and assimilation-related data are collected in the second phase, may be more objective in analyzing how organizational and environmental factors affect ERP diffusion. More work needs to be done to better understand further interactions between technology evaluation and imitation within a given organization and its industry. At the organization level, evaluation and imitation may displace one another by degrees. But at the industry level, evaluation and imitation may complement each other to create an evolving landscape of supposition, hopeful belief, and qualified knowledge [78]. Further research is needed to empirically validate these two levels of imitation–evaluation interactions. In addition, the imitation–evaluation interaction pattern may not be linear and direct but subject to contingencies such as organizing visions, industry norms, diffusion processes, and organization characteristics. Future investigation into these interaction contingencies should yield valuable insights into what constitutes effective strategies for the implementation of technology evaluation and social imitation. Likewise, researchers may want to extend our model to include more mediating variables that can clarify the roles of imitation and evaluation in ERP assimilation. These mediators may include implementation strategy and assimilation processes [78]. Finally, we have provided compelling results that may be attributed to the unique business environment in China (e.g., a state-controlled economy with many SOEs), but this is just a starting point. Future studies are needed to differentiate between technology adoption and assimilation approaches in the context of different economic and organizational structures. In addition, more research with a strategic perspective is warranted given the prevalence of technology evaluation and social imitation and their potential consequences, not only regarding ERP but also other significant IT investments. For example, researchers could examine whether an organization’s imitation–evaluation strategies and responses to competition mitigate rivalry within an industry and affect the consequential adoption and assimilation of ERP. Research has suggested that an organization’s differentiation strategy can reduce imitation to insulate rival actions and a homogeneous strategy can promote imitation to ease the intensity of competition [53]. Accordingly, such strategic selection may be deemed to have a consequential effect on the extent of ERP adoption and assimilation.\n",

Our results reveal that both DOI imitation and evaluation are important forces for ERP diffusion, and their influences on ERP adoption and assimilation are roughly equal. However, the forces of imitation and evaluation on ERP diffusion vary according to different contingencies. The most unexpected findings are that management beliefs and participation have insignificant effects on the use of imitation or evaluation approaches to both ERP adoption and assimilation. We believe that these results may be attributable to China’s state-controlled economy as SOEs constituted the majority of this study’s sample. These findings provide a foundation for further research on adoption and assimilation of organizational innovations.\n",

            "1. Chinese people also dislike certain characters that symbolize something undesirable. Typical examples are numbers such as “4” and “24,” which are synonymous with “dead” and “easy to die.” Not many Chinese people like their phone numbers, employee identification numbers, or residence numbers to be associated with these numbers. Such factors are not considered in Western ERP design. 2. Similarly, Rice et al. [68] argued that the dichotomy between the rational and the social is artificial and perhaps unnecessary. Webster and Trevino [87] even suggested bringing the two approaches together by incorporating factors from both theories. 3. In the field of management, for example, imitation research has developed several theories to explain organizational and individual imitation. Organizational theorists have attempted to explain the unique behavior patterns associated with imitation by referring to the “bandwagon effect” [29], which is a diffusion process in which an organization’s leaders feel pressured to adopt an innovation due to the sheer number of other organizations that have already adopted it in earlier stages [70]. 4. In addition, many DOI studies (e.g., [1, 50]) have used only these three variables. 5. In situations where clarification was required, the interviewers contacted committee members for confirmation after they had had a chance to review the relevant archives. In this way, we minimized the risks associated with response inaccuracy due to memory lapses. 6. The first completed survey instrument from each interviewer was carefully reviewed to assess the quality and reliability of the data collection. Any issue identified in this review process was discussed with the interviewer before he or she resumed the interviews. Then, 56 surveys were randomly chosen for validation. The interviewees were contacted by the project supervisor, who randomly selected a few items from the questionnaire for the interviewees to\n",

            "reanswer. This validation process ensured not only data reliability but also that the interviewees to whom responses were attributed had actually been interviewed. Although this measure was implemented on a small scale, we found little deviation between interviewees’ first and second responses and no fault associated with the interviewers. 7. First, all student interviewers were briefed on the potential side effects of cross-sectional data. Thus, they were asked to mark on the questionnaire if an informant had been unsure or hesitant in their responses. These marked questionnaires, although limited, were followed up for validation. Second, the interviewees had to be senior executives, key ERP decision makers, or educated ERP professionals serving on an ERP steering committee to enhance response quality and minimize response bias [47, 75]. Third, the interviewees were asked to provide documentation of ERP adoption and assimilation, if possible, as a secondary data source. These documents were used in validating their survey responses. Last, we performed statistical analyses on CMV, and compared early and late adopters to ensure the validity of our cross-sectional data. 8. Although there are other potential aspects of DOI, these three dimensions are the most widely used. DOI research in the past few decades validated that a large number of innovation characteristics were critical to adoption and diffusion of innovations [71]. However, it generalized the relationship between 25 innovation characteristics and adoption and diffusion from their meta-analysis of seventy-five research articles. They identified ten characteristics that were most frequently studied by researchers: compatibility, relative advantage, complexity, cost, communicability, divisibility, profitability, social approval, trialability, and observability. Of these ten characteristics, compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity were consistently found to be significant. Since this time, many DOI research studies in the information systems field have employed these three variables in their innovation adoption and diffusion studies [9, 32, 48]. Therefore, in our study, only these three aspects were used to represent DOI. It is clear that these three aspects are distinct and can move in different directions theoretically; thus, based on leading guidelines on formative construct specification and measurement, we specified DOI as a formative construct with compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity as its subdimensions. 9. This is particularly true not just for SOEs but for firms that are shielded from international competition such as in oil and gas, technology, steel production, and the like. In fact, collective and locally government-owned enterprises are shown to be even less efficient and less competitive than SOEs [40].\n",
