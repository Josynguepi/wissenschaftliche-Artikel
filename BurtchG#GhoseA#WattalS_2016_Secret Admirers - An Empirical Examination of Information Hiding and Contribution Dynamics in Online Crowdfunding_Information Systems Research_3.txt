ndividuals’ actions in online social contexts are growing increasingly visible and traceable. Many online platforms account for this by providing users with granular control over when and how their identity or actions are made visible to peers.

We leverage a unique impression-level data set from one of the world’s largest online crowdfunding platforms, where contributors are given the option to conceal their username or contribution amount from public display, with each transaction. We demonstrate that when campaign contributors elect to conceal information, it has a negative inﬂuence on subsequent visitors’ likelihood of conversion, as well as on their average contributions, conditional on conversion. Moreover, we argue that social norms are an important driver of information concealment, providing evidence of peer inﬂuence in the decision to conceal. We discuss the implications of our results for the provision of online information hiding mechanisms, as well as the design of crowdfunding platforms and electronic markets more generally.

Introduction

Individuals’ actions in online social contexts are growing increasingly visible and traceable. Many online platforms account for this by providing users with granular control over when and how their identity or actions are made visible to peers. However, little work has sought to understand the effect that a user’s decision to conceal information might have on observing peers, who are likely to refer to that information when deciding on their own actions. Crowdfunding is one online social context that has recently gained prominence and attention, where users (campaign contributors) are capable of concealing or revealing information in a granular, dynamic fashion (Burtch et al. 2015). Crowdfunding is a collective process, wherein individuals pitch their projects to the crowd, with the goal of raising the money required to see those projects to fruition. The crowd then ultimately acts as arbiter, deciding whether projects are funded, or not. However, the crowd is faced with a tough choice. They must evaluate the
478

quality of a campaign with relatively little information to go on, and they often have little to no recourse should things go awry. A number of recent studies have shown that crowdfunders therefore refer not only to the campaign pitch; they also refer to information about the contribution decisions of their peers (Burtch et al. 2013, 2016; Zhang and Liu 2012)—e.g., to gauge the quality of a campaign, or to gain a sense of what constitutes an appropriate contribution amount. However, when those peers opt to conceal information about their transaction (i.e., username or contribution amount), such inference becomes difﬁcult. Moreover, observing information concealment by prior contributors may instill a general sense of unease in later visitors to the campaign, who may perceive that something is amiss (Solove 2007). Taken together, this implies a signiﬁcant potential that information hiding will have negative impacts on subsequent campaign fundraising. What, then, drives the decision to reveal or conceal information? Prior work suggests that this decision depends on a number of factors, including a

479 assessing the effect of information hiding behavior on downstream fundraising outcomes. Our key ﬁndings are as follows. First, we ﬁnd evidence of peer inﬂuence in the hiding decision. Individuals are more likely to conceal information of a particular type, whether username or contribution amount, when prior contributors have also done so. Marginal effect estimates suggest that when the ﬁve prior contributors conceal their contribution amounts, a focal contributor is 7% more likely to do so as well. Similarly, when the ﬁve prior contributors conceal their identities, a focal contributor is 12% more likely to do so as well. Second, we ﬁnd that hiding one’s username, in particular, has a negative inﬂuence on subsequent campaign visitors’ likelihood of conversion, as well as their contribution amounts, conditional on conversion. When ﬁve prior contributors conceal their usernames, a subsequent campaign visitor is 2% less likely to convert. Moreover, even if they should decide to convert, they contribute 6% ($4.89) less to the campaign, on average. This work makes a number of novel contributions. First, we build on recent work dealing with the role of user information controls in online crowdfunding markets. Burtch et al. (2015) employ a randomized ﬁeld experiment in a reward-based crowdfunding market to explore the impact of information control provision on crowdfunder behavior, ﬁnding that providing information control mechanisms can prime crowdfunders with privacy concerns. However, whereas that work looks at the individual effect of merely providing information controls, we study the peer effect from prior others’ use of those information controls, conditional on provision. Second, we extend prior work in information systems around peer inﬂuence in individuals’ tendency to reveal or conceal identity-related information in online social settings (Forman et al. 2008), speciﬁcally in Amazon online reviews. Whereas in that context the default outcome was concealment and users were required to opt-in to revealing information, we study the reverse scenario; a setting in which the default outcome is revelation, where individuals must optout. This has interesting implications for the mechanism at work because intent can only be ascribed when action is taken, which in turn depends on the opt-in or opt-out nature of the information control design. In our case, intent is thus ascribed to the decision to conceal information at the time of transaction. This is notable, because an explicit decision to conceal may be viewed with unease by other users. Taken together, these observations suggest that the default setting for information controls can have important implications for platform dynamics and social interaction (Johnson et al. 2002).

general desire to avoid the risk of disapproval from others (Jones and Linardi 2014), to protect one’s privacy (Jiang et al. 2013) or peer inﬂuence—e.g., via a social norm (Forman et al. 2008). Here, we focus on the latter factor, peer inﬂuence among contributors in the campaign fundraising process, and we examine the effect of the information hiding decision on the conversion and contribution behavior of subsequent campaign visitors. More formally, the research questions we address in this study are as follows: To what degree does peer inﬂuence drive information hiding in crowdfunding campaign contributions? How does information hiding inﬂuence contributions of subsequent campaign visitors? Social norms inﬂuence behavior because seeing what others have done provides information about what is socially “normal” in a given context. As more people are observed responding to the same situation in the same way, the more likely it is that the observer will perceive the behavioral response as correct (Surowiecki 2004, Thibaut and Kelley 1959). In turn, the perceived prevalence of a behavior determines an individual’s belief about appropriate courses of action in a given situation (Cialdini and Trost 1998, Cialdini and Goldstein 2004). A number of studies have shown that identitybased attachment to a community can be a particularly strong driver of adherence to perceived social norms, even in online settings subject to relative anonymity. Postmes and his colleagues (2000, 2001) have shown that normative behavior is quite likely to manifest in online identity-based communities, and that de-individuation or anonymity increases the prevalence of such behavior. Similarly, Sassenberg (2002) showed that identity-based groups were more likely to adhere to group norms than those that were bond based. In crowdfunding, as we will argue, campaigns may be viewed as temporary online communities, and campaign contributors will frequently perceive themselves as members of those communities. To study our research questions, we collected data from one of the world’s largest global platforms for reward-based crowdfunding. This platform has millions of registered users located in over 200 countries and regions around the world, it draws more than nine million visitors each month, and has hosted over 200,000 crowdfunding campaigns to date. The data set we leverage captures every visit, to every active campaign on the platform, over a two-month period. This sample includes information on when the visit took place, and the outcome of the visit, in terms of the amount of any contribution the visitor decided to make. Importantly, we observe a visit even when a visitor opts to contribute nothing ($0), thus we are able to avoid any issues of censoring or selection in

480 Related to the above, recent work has highlighted that individuals value their privacy differently, depending on whether they are endowed with it to begin with (Acquisti et al. 2013), behavior that derives from the endowment effect and loss aversion. This, in turn, suggests another reason why default settings are likely to have extremely important implications for platform dynamics and individual behavior, in the crowdfunding context speciﬁcally, but also more generally in online social settings. Third, we argue that the effect of prior information revelation or concealment on subsequent contributions operates via a novel mechanism, quite different than that considered in past work (e.g., Forman et al. 2008). The degree to which potential consumers put stock in a consumer opinion or product evaluation has been shown to depend on identity revelation chieﬂy because revelation is tied to source credibility. This issue is of particular salience when it comes to online reviews because many individuals who author reviews have not, in fact, purchased the product (Anderson and Simester 2014), and many reviews are simply fake (Luca and Zervas 2016). By contrast, in our setting, information revelation pertains directly to an economic transaction (the campaign contribution), which is an objective record of activity that is veriﬁed by the platform. Thus, the transaction itself is not in question. Furthermore, although one might argue that later contributors would be concerned that anonymous donors are simply friends and family attempting to conceal their connection with the organizer, pseudonyms are readily available. As such, it does not appear feasible that source credibility (or its absence) is the mechanism driving this effect. Instead, we argue that the mechanism in our setting pertains to a general sense of unease that arises when other parties are observed transacting anonymously, otherwise known as the “I’ve got nothing to hide” argument (Solove 2007). To our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst to consider and document evidence of an “anonymity spillover” effect of this sort, which has great relevance in any setting dealing with online social commerce and information control features. In the following section, we begin with a review of relevant literature on the subject of crowdfunding and social norms. In Section 3, we formulate our hypotheses. In Section 4, we describe our study context. In Section 5, we discuss our methods, including our data set, our empirical speciﬁcation, and our identiﬁcation strategy. Section 6 presents the results of our estimations, which we then interpret and discuss in Section 7, before concluding with suggestions for future research directions.

Literature Review

2.1. Crowdfunding There is an emerging stream of research that has examined the concept of crowdfunding, deﬁned as a collective effort by individuals who network and pool their money together, usually via the Internet, to invest in or support the efforts of others (Ordanini et al. 2010). Loan-based crowdfunding markets have seen the greatest consideration by academics. Lin et al. (2013) study a loan-based market, Prosper.com, ﬁnding that the likelihood of credit being issued is greater when the borrower exhibits greater social capital. In the same context, Zhang and Liu (2012) ﬁnd evidence of herding and, counter to intuition, that lenders are more likely to herd when the borrower exhibits signals of low quality. Most recently, Lin and Viswanathan (2015) report evidence that lenders prefer geographically proximate borrowers, evidence of a home bias. In terms of work on equity crowdfunding, Ahlers et al. (2015) examine data from an Australian platform, reporting on the roles of different types of information (e.g., ﬁnancials, risk assessments) as drivers of investment. Kim and Viswanathan (2014) study the AppBackr marketplace, reporting on the important inﬂuence of opinion leadership and investment expertise. Burtch et al. (2013, 2014) provide two notable examples of research on donation-based crowdfunding. In their ﬁrst study, the authors ﬁnd evidence of social inﬂuence and crowding out between contributors in the crowdfunding process. In their latter study, these authors examine the role of cultural differences between contributors and fundraisers, ﬁnding that these differences impact contributors’ selection of borrowers. Finally, there has been a recent surge of research on reward-based crowdfunding platforms, such as the one we study here. Agrawal et al. (2015) have looked at the role of physical distance between contributors and fundraisers at Sellaband, ﬁnding that collocated contributors arrive earlier, and that the effect is largely driven by friends, family, and fans. Mollick (2014) examined Kickstarter, ﬁnding that the majority of fundraising can be explained by underlying project quality and the size of campaign organizers’ social networks. There are two particularly notable areas of work that have recently emerged in the crowdfunding space, which are most closely related to our study. The ﬁrst area is comprised of studies that have explored the role of community in online crowdfunding, and a desire to join a community, as a driver of contribution—e.g., the work by Gerber and Hui (2013), Hartley (2010), Hui et al. (2014), and Liu et al. (2012). The

481 Social categorization effects manifest when a group of individuals is labeled or identiﬁed based on some shared criteria, whether objective, e.g., membership in an organization, or subjective, e.g., ideological beliefs (Postmes and Spears 2000, Turner 1985). Interdependence is present when members of a group are dependent on one another in the completion of some joint task, when they share a common purpose or share a common fate. These conditions exist when the contributions of one group member (or lack thereof) inﬂuence the outcome for all group members—e.g., team performance (Postmes et al. 2001). Finally, intergroup comparison refers to members of a group actively comparing themselves with other groups. These intergroup comparisons raise the salience of out-groups, intensifying in-group commitment (Hogg and Terry 2000). In the crowdfunding context, although intergroup comparison is unlikely, there is clear evidence of social categorization and interdependence. Categorization is apparent in that contributors are collectively identiﬁed on a campaign page as supporters of that project. Campaign contributions reﬂect support or preference for a common interest, suggesting that the individuals supplying them identify with the cause or idea that the organizer is pursuing (Gerber and Hui 2013). Interdependence is even clearer. Crowdfunders rely on the contributions of others to help see a campaign reach its fundraising target, the project implemented, and rewards shipped. No single contributor achieves this independently; they rely on one another to make this happen. Although some crowdfunding campaigns do not employ a provision point mechanism (see Varian 2013 for a discussion of provision point mechanisms in crowdfunding), failure to meet a speciﬁed fundraising target is nonetheless indicative of project failure. If one views the fundraising target as representative of the ﬁxed cost of implementation, it is not clear what output a campaign would produce if the fundraising target were not met. Indeed, this is one of the primary motivations for instituting a provision point mechanism. If we allow that the collection of contributors supporting a crowdfunding campaign can be characterized as an identity-based community, then there is a clear potential for social norms to manifest in a strong way. As noted above, individuals perceive a norm when the social group exhibits consistent behavior across group members (Postmes et al. 2000). On most crowdfunding platforms, contributors are able to observe other contributors via a campaignspeciﬁc, sequential list of prior contributors (e.g., a “Funders” or “Backers” tab). In our study context, the list provides information on who contributed, as well as how much they contributed. This same list also

second is the recent work by Burtch et al. (2015), described in Section 1, which studies the individual effect of providing information controls on crowdfunder contributions. 2.2. Social Norms and Identity-Based Attachment1 As described in Section 1, we focus here on the role of peer inﬂuence, arguing for the importance of descriptive social norms. Descriptive social norms are subjective, and refer to an individual’s belief about how common a particular behavior or response is in a given context, among some relevant population (Cialdini et al. 1991). When an individual observes others responding in a particular way, this provides information about what is considered to be acceptable behavior (Surowiecki 2004, Thibaut and Kelley 1959). In turn, the perceived prevalence of a behavior determines an individual’s belief about appropriate courses of action in a given situation (Cialdini and Trost 1998, Cialdini and Goldstein 2004). A lengthy stream of literature has reported the surprising ease and speed with which social inﬂuence can manifest in temporary groups, even those comprised of complete strangers. Notable examples include the formation of “swift trust” (Meyerson et al. 1996, p. 167) and Asch (1951) classic psychological experiments, demonstrating subjects’ tendency to conform to judgments made by the group, even when that group is comprised of strangers. The literature on descriptive social norms is similarly replete with examples of individuals adhering to norms established by complete strangers, and in the absence of any social interaction (e.g., Allcott 2011, Gerber and Rogers 2009, Ferraro and Price 2013). At the same time, that same literature has also noted that descriptive norms are particularly inﬂuential when established by similar others who face a similar decision-making scenario (Goldstein et al. 2008). In our setting, a particularly salient population for a campaign contributor will be the set of prior contributors to the very same campaign. Researchers have demonstrated that common identity arises from three main sources. These include social categorization, interdependence among individuals, and intergroup comparison (Ren et al. 2007).

There are other aspects to crowdfunding campaigns that suggest plausible conditions for the formation of online communities, and contributors’ perception that they belong to that community, through bond-based attachment. Campaign organizers post campaign updates for contributors as they progress through their project, to keep contributors abreast of developments. These updates take the form of blog posts, which draw contributors back to the campaign page. Additionally, many crowdfunding platforms allow contributors to post comments to a campaign page in a discussion thread format (e.g., Kickstarter, IndieGoGo), providing a forum for social interaction.

482 provides a way for contributors to see what information other recent contributors (by default, the ﬁve most recent contributors would be displayed) have or have not chosen to reveal, namely, their username or contribution amount. The fact that only particularly recent contributors are initially shown is also important. This is because recent work notes that individuals tend to assume that every member of a group will behave in the same manner as the (generally smaller number of) individuals they can readily observe, an effect known as the majority illusion (Lerman et al. 2016). If the observed individuals tend to behave in a consistent way, an observer is likely to generalize that observation and assume that everybody else in the population will behave that way too, even though it is quite possible that exactly the opposite is true. As a result, it is quite possible for individuals arriving at the same campaign at different points in time to perceive a completely different norm, and respond accordingly.

Hypothesis Development

Based on our review of the literature above, we anticipate that contributor information hiding of any particular type will be subject to peer inﬂuence, deriving from the observable behavior of other recent contributors. We propose here that concealing information, whether in regard to contributor username or contribution amount, will be driven by prior others’ observed decisions in the same regard. We argue that this results from the mechanism of descriptive social norms. Our logic is supported by numerous studies that have considered the emergence of socially normative behavior in identity-based online communities, and the literature on descriptive social norms in particular. We therefore formalize our ﬁrst hypothesis as follows. Hypothesis 1 (H1). Concealment of usernames or contribution amounts in previous contributions toward a particular campaign will be positively associated with concealment of similar information in subsequent contributions toward that campaign. Next, considering the impact of prior contributors’ information concealment on subsequent fundraising outcomes, we expect that subsequent campaign visitors will be less likely to contribute when this happens. Moreover, we expect that, even if those visitors should choose to contribute, they will contribute in smaller amounts. These two expectations derive the fact that an absence of information is more likely to result in indecision, inaction, or skepticism. Additionally, an absence of information implies greater uncertainty, and thus a lower conﬁdence in the contribution decision.

It is useful here to consider the informational value of a username in our setting. Although in many cases a user’s name on the platform is her real name, in many cases it is an obvious pseudonym. Clarke (2014, p. 184) provides a useful discussion of pseudo-identiﬁers, or digital personas, which he deﬁnes as “model[s] of an individual’s public personality, based on data, maintained by transactions, and intended for use as a proxy for the individual.” The association of a pseudonym with a transaction, unlike a completely anonymous transaction, provides third-party observers with at least some degree of transparency. The digital persona may be linked to multiple transactions over time, thus it can bear reputation. Moreover, the persona may be linked to other proﬁles, such as social media accounts. As such, the use of a pseudonym is distinct from a purely anonymous transaction. As noted in Section 1, the broader logic that underlies an anticipated negative relationship between information concealment and subsequent conversion and contribution derives from the idea that, when others engage in information concealment, it tends to result in a sense of unease on the part of observers; the “I’ve got nothing to hide” argument (Solove 2007). The logic underlying this argument, though ﬂawed for a number of reasons, is that people will not choose to conceal information unless they have a speciﬁc reason for doing so. Potential contributors, thinking this way, may respond by opting out of a contribution or by committing lesser funds to what might ultimately turn out to be a risky transaction. Our expectation is also supported by the ﬁndings of Gneezy et al. (2012), who study pay what you want (PWYW) pricing in a retail setting. Those authors show that many consumers prefer not to transact at all in the absence of information about other consumers’ decisions, out of a fear that their behavior might unintentionally be “unfair.” In crowdfunding, a lack of information about other group members or their contribution amounts could similarly result in uncertainty about what constitutes an appropriate contribution. Extensive research in crowdfunding has noted that campaign contributors refer to the contribution behavior of prior others as a way of evaluating campaign quality or anticipating the likelihood of fundraising success (Burtch et al. 2013, Zhang and Liu 2012). Thus, the elimination or concealment of this relevant information may impede the ability of subsequent visitors to properly evaluate a campaign, or it may cause them to evaluate a campaign less favorably, resulting in reduced contributions. Bearing the above factors in mind, more formally, we propose the following hypothesis.

Study Context

Our study focuses on one of the world’s largest global platforms for reward-based crowdfunding. This marketplace enables anyone, in any location, to raise money for a venture, cause, or idea. The marketplace is highly trafﬁcked, attracting upward of 200,000 visitors per day, and facilitating millions of dollars in campaign contributions each month. Since being founded approximately ﬁve years ago, the platform has attracted more than one million registered users from more than 200 countries around the globe. The marketplace allows submission of any and all ventures. When fundraisers submit their project to the marketplace for posting, they must deﬁne a number of campaign characteristics. These characteristics include the rewards the organizer plans to offer, what the organizer intends to do with the money, how much money they are attempting to raise, the planned funding duration and the “funding format.”2 Campaigns are presented to website visitors in order of popularity (measured algorithmically by the purveyor, based on organizer effort, contribution activity, media coverage, etc.), though there are a variety of ﬁltering and sorting mechanisms available to support campaign search efforts. The home page also highlights new campaigns and campaigns that are ending soon. The visitor is presented with the ability to ﬁlter ongoing campaigns based on location (city) or proximity (“near me”), or by category (e.g., technology, small business, causes).3 Once an individual has decided to contribute to a particular campaign, they must then indicate how much they wish to contribute. Contributors are then asked to provide an email and physical address (if they chose to claim a reward). At this point, the contributor is presented with a question about how they want their contribution record to appear on the campaign’s funder list. These are the controls that are the focus of our study.
2

The contributor is given the option to (a) conceal their username, (b) conceal the amount of the contribution, or (c) leave the record as is, and conceal nothing (note: these options are mutually exclusive).4 Importantly, a contributor’s username and amount will always be viewable to the campaign organizer; the hidden information is masked only from the contributor’s peers. Finally, the contributor is then given an option to leave a comment on their contribution record, and to share their contribution via social media, before being taken to the payment-processing page. In our data set, a large fraction of contributions (27%) exhibit username or amount hiding. Figure 1 presents a screenshot from our study context,5 depicting a list of campaign contribution records, with some contributors opting to conceal their username (“Anonymous”), some opting to conceal their contribution amount (“Private”), and some opting to conceal nothing.

Methods

In the all-or-nothing format, the fundraiser only receives the contributed funds if the campaign’s funding target is met. The beneﬁt of this approach is that, if the fundraiser should succeed, the platform fees that the organizer must pay are quite a bit smaller (∼5% of all funds). By contrast, in the keep what you raise format, a fundraiser is required to pay a much higher fee (∼10%).

Information-hiding mechanisms of this sort are relatively common in online crowdfunding. Some other prominent platforms that employ these features include GoFundMe.com, GiveForward.com, and CrowdRise.com.

The campaign organizer (rather than the marketplace purveyor) determines the campaign category. As such, there are no strict rules around the assignment of categories, thus these groupings are fuzzy and may overlap.

2013. In our visit-level data, we observe a conversion rate of 32.4%—that is, approximately one-third of campaign visits resulted in a contribution. Our overall sample includes 7,603 campaigns, though we only observe 1,377 campaigns through to their fundraising deadline and thus the ﬁnal amount raised, because many campaigns were scheduled to be completed after we performed data collection.

485 approximately 145,000 of the website visitors, before they proceeded elsewhere (whether into the contribution ﬂow for that campaign or elsewhere). We found that more than 40,000 of those visitors completed their interaction with the campaign by looking at the list of prior funders. This number provides a lower bound on the fraction of visitors exhibiting this behavior, because some proportion of the other 70% of visits would have included the Funders tab at an earlier point in their visit, which we do not observe. This establishes a clear potential for peer inﬂuence and/or community norms to manifest. 5.2. Model Speciﬁcation Based on our hypotheses, we estimate two models, one capturing the antecedents of the hiding decision for contributors, and the other capturing the effect of that hiding on subsequent campaign visitors’ expected contributions. Notably, the latter model is estimated on visit-level data, thus we are not faced with any censoring issues. In our ﬁrst model (Equation (1)), CONCEALMENT ji is a binary indicator of whether contribution i, made toward campaign j , was concealed in some way. Here, reﬂects the type of information that was concealed (i.e., the contributor’s identity or contribution amount). Our parameter of interest is , which captures the relationship between prior and subsequent concealing of a particular type of information by sequential contributors. A positive coefﬁcient would be taken as evidence in support of Hypothesis 1.6 CONCEALMENT ji = CONCEALMENT ji−1 + Xji + j + ji (1)

Our controls are primarily captured by X , a vector of contribution-speciﬁc covariates, including the campaign fundraising status—comprised of the dollars raised to date and the number of days the campaign has been in fundraising (i.e., CAMPAIGN_BALANCE, DAYS_IN_FUNDING)—at the time of the observation, the amount of the contribution (CONTRIBUTION), the value of any reward the contributor claimed (REWARD_V ALUE), whether the contributor was newly registered on the platform within the prior 48 hours (NEW_USER), and whether the user was formally associated with the campaign, j ,

Although our speciﬁcation in Equation (1) only considers the effect of the most recent prior contributor, our estimations actually relax this assumption to consider the effect of multiple prior contributors, namely, the 5 and 10 most recent. When interpreting our results, we focus primarily on the ﬁve most recent contributors, based on the user interface depicted in Figure 1. A campaign visitor can easily view the ﬁve most recent contributors when navigating to the Funders tab; however, if a visitor wishes to view older contributions, they are required to click a Show More button, which reveals an additional ﬁve prior contributions.

486 as a CAMPAIGN_ORGANIZER. Acknowledging the potential role of “sticky” contributor behaviors, we also include controls for contributor i’s most recent prior concealment activity and contribution amounts, in transactions involving the last campaign they supported, j − 1 (CONCEALMENT ji−1 , CONTRIBUTION ji−1 . Last, our vector of controls also includes daily time dummies, capturing any unobserved temporal dynamics that might inﬂuence concealing behavior (e.g., changes in platform privacy policies), and is a vector of campaign ﬁxed effects. It is also worth taking a moment here to consider our choice of estimators for Equation (1). In the case of our concealment model, we are examining a behavior that pertains speciﬁcally to individuals who offer some positive contribution to the campaign. That is, conditional on conversion, individuals may choose to reveal or conceal different pieces of information. Contributors’ may conceal nothing, their identity, or their contribution amount (i.e., the options are mutually exclusive). Bearing this in mind, the ideal choice of estimator is multinomial logit. However, implementing campaign ﬁxed effects with a multinomial logit estimator is a challenge, due to the incidental parameters problem, as is the incorporation of instrumental variables. Accordingly, we opt to employ a linear probability model (LPM), an estimator that allows us to account for ﬁxed effects, in addition to autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in the error term, as well as to eventually introduce instrumental variables. Using the LPM, we estimate separate models for each of the hiding alternatives, identity hiding and amount hiding. However, we subsequently consider the results of a pooled multinomial logit estimation in our robustness checks, and demonstrate the consistency of our results. Considering our second model (Equation (2)), we repeat our basic speciﬁcation from Equation (1), though we replace our dependent variable with CONTRIBUTION jv . This is a continuous measure of the number of dollars contributed as a result of visit v to campaign j . Our parameter of interest in this estimation is , which captures the effect of prior contributors’ concealment. A negative coefﬁcient here would be taken as evidence in support of Hypothesis 2 CONTRIBUTION jv = CONCEALMENT jv−1 + Qjv +

Here, Q captures the majority of our controls, a vector of visit-speciﬁc covariates. Because the contribution model is based on visit-level data, rather than
7

contribution-level data, we cannot identify visitors and their personal characteristics if they chose not to contribute. That being said, we continue to control for all available campaign covariates. Our dynamic campaign covariates are the same as those previously mentioned in our concealment model above. Because the inclusion of unconditional ﬁxed effects would introduce bias into our Tobit estimation, in this case, instead comprises of controls for various static campaign characteristics. These controls include an indicator of whether the campaign is following an all or nothing format (THRESHOLD_FUNDRAISER), whether any rewards are available to contributors (HAS_REWARDS), the campaign fundraising target (TARGET), the campaign fundraising duration (DURATION), as well as a series of campaign category dummies. Subscripts v and v − 1 refer to the sequence of individuals arriving at campaign j from the focal visitor’s perspective. To clarify, it is possible, from a given visitor’s perspective, that following the most recent contribution, but before the focal visitor’s arrival, other individuals might have visited the campaign without contributing funds. However, such visitors would not be observable to the focal visitor and thus would have no effect on their behavior. As such, index v refers to the observed sequence of campaign visitors from the perspective of each focal visitor, at the time of their visit. That is, v − 1 for the next visitor would not refer to observation v for the current visitor, if the current visitor opts not to contribute funds. Once again, we will take a moment to consider our estimator choice. Our data do not suffer from a censoring issue, as noted above, because we observe every visitor to the campaign page, regardless of whether they ultimately chose to contribute. However, we do observe a large fraction of visitors choosing not to contribute (i.e., many 0s). This scenario represents a corner solution model, with a large probability mass around zero (Lee 2009, Wooldridge 2002). Wooldridge (2002) explains corner solution models using the example of charitable contributions, which is notably a very similar context to crowdfunding. There, he discusses the fact that many families are observed contributing $0 to charity in a given year. This outcome does not reﬂect an issue of censoring, per se; rather, it reﬂects a valid choice outcome. In some sense, the outcome variable can therefore be viewed as a mixture of two distributions: one discrete, i.e., the visitor’s initial choice between y = 0 and
sense, because we do not have repeated observations of campaigns at consistent intervals. Instead, the intervals between our observations are determined by the timing of contributor or visitor arrival. For this reason, we exclude a time subscript from our variables; however, we still incorporate day effects into our model, based on the date on which an observation took place.

Our models are, respectively, constructed based on campaigncontributor and campaign-visitor pairs. Thus, we consider repeated observations of the same campaign, where each observation pertains to a different contribution or visit. A notable implication of this is that our data do not constitute panel data in the traditional

y > 0, and the other continuous, i.e., the visitor’s second choice about the size of y , given y > 0. Notably, under these conditions, Wooldridge (2002) shows that an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is inconsistent, and instead advocates for the application of a Tobit estimator. Studies in information systems have made use of a Tobit estimator under similar conditions. As two examples, Ghose and Yao (2011) used Tobit regression to analyze price dispersion in electronic markets, noting that price differences across transactions exhibit a high proportion of 0s, and Simonsohn (2010) used Tobit regression to analyze item sale prices on eBay, assigning $0 values to any that went unsold. 5.3. Endogeneity and Estimation Approach Our initial estimation of the concealment model employs OLS, whereas that of our contribution model employs Tobit (for the reasons discussed above). In each case, it is important to consider possible sources of endogeneity with respect to our key independent variable, prior others’ hiding behavior. In the case of our ﬁrst model, positive sequential correlation in concealment could arise simply because of correlated dynamic unobservables, pertaining to campaign quality perception. That is, it may be the case that patterns of behavior cluster together as a result of correlated, dynamic unobserved inﬂuences, such as variance in campaign organizer effort over the course of fundraising, or platform purveyor marketing activities, which might feature certain campaigns. Prior others’ concealment may also be endogenous in our second model, because individuals may choose to conceal their identity or actions at the same time others’ choose not to contribute, as a result of a spurious relationship (e.g., dynamic unobservable characteristics of the campaign). To account for these possible sources of endogeneity, we rely on instrumental variable regressions. We

construct a set of user-speciﬁc behavioral instruments, based on repeated historical observations across different campaign contributions. Historical behavior is theoretically and conceptually valid as an instrument if we assume that users exhibit sticky behaviors. If contributors exhibit a preference for different hiding or revealing behaviors for spells of time, across transactions, out of habit for instance, then a contributor’s decision to conceal their identity or contribution amount will correlate with the same decisions they have made in contributions to other, previous campaigns. At the same time, those prior decisions, involving contributions to completely different campaigns, should have no association with the behavior of subsequent contributors to the focal campaign (with the exception of the hypothesized peer effects).8 Notably, lagged instruments analogous to those we describe here are applied frequently in practice (Arellano and Bover 1995, Blundell and Bond 1998). To clarify the construction of our instrument, we offer the following example. Consider two campaigns, 1 and 2, which share contributor X (represented by the white dot in Figure 2), who precedes our focal contributor, Y , whose behavior we are interested in modeling, within campaign 2. To understand how X ’s behavior in campaign 2 will inﬂuence Y ’s behavior in campaign 2, we leverage X ’s prior behavior in campaign 1. In practice, when constructing our instruments, we focus on only the most recent prior
8

Although a homophily argument may still apply under this instrumental setup, particularly around sequential hiding activities. However, subsequent robustness checks that we have conducted demonstrate robustness of our estimations to the inclusion of contributor ﬁxed effects. Controlling for static features of contributors rules out static homophily as an alternative explanation for our results.

contribution X has made to another campaign (bearing in mind that X may have contributed to a great many other campaigns previously). Thus, we instrument for the most recent contributor’s identity hiding on their focal campaign contribution with a binary indicator of their identity hiding on their most recent prior contribution to a different crowdfunding campaign. We also construct an analogous instrument for the most recent prior contributor’s amount hiding behavior. We repeat estimation of our two models, employing two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation in the case of our concealment model, and IV-Tobit regression in the case of our contribution model, focusing on the most recent prior contributor.9 10

Results

Attempting to expand our instrumental variable estimations to the speciﬁcations involving ﬁve prior contributors reduces our usable sample size to just 585 observations, because valid observations are limited to those in which all ﬁve prior contributors have previously supported at least one other campaign. Similarly, in the case of our speciﬁcation considering 10 prior contributors, we would have no valid observations for the purposes of an IV-estimation.
10 We retain these instrumental variable analyses only as robustness checks because they are generally less precise, and because we

6.1. Concealment We ﬁrst provide the results of our hiding estimations. In Tables 4 and 5 we see the LPM results, respectively, considering identity and amount hiding outcomes. We preﬁx historical behavior by the focal contributor with S (self), and that of prior contributors to the same campaign with O (other). For example, the preﬁx O1 refers to the behavior of the most recent prior contributor, whereas the preﬁx S1 refers to the behavior of the focal contributor in their most recent prior contribution to another campaign. In column 1 of each table, we focus on the behavior of the most recent prior contributor. In column 2, acknowledging that a visitor to the campaign page would be able to see the ﬁve most recent contributors, by default, we consider the average behavior exhibited by the ﬁve most recent prior contributors. Finally, in column 3, we consider the average hiding behavior
lack the data required to construct analogous instruments for larger sets of prior contributors. Accordingly, these estimations serve primarily to validate the robustness of our initial results to potential endogeneity.

of the 10 most recent prior contributors (note: these additional ﬁve prior contributors could be viewed by clicking a Show More option at the bottom of the page). Across each model, we observe relatively consistent results. In the case of username hiding (Table 4), we observe a signiﬁcant, positive association between prior others’ identity hiding and a subsequent contributor’s identity hiding. When we expand our focus to the ﬁve most recent prior contributors, we continue to observe a signiﬁcant association, and the effect size grows larger, suggesting that visitors do consider more than just the most recent prior contributor. However, considering the behavior of the 10 most recent prior contributors, the effect fades to insigniﬁcance. This observation is consistent with our expectations, given that that the sixth through 10th prior contributors would not be visible, by default. In the case of amount hiding (Table 5), we observe a similar pattern of results. We see a signiﬁcant, positive association between prior others’ amount hiding and a subsequent contributor’s amount hiding. This effect continues to manifest when we expand our focus to the ﬁve most recent contributors. Looking

at the 10 most recent, however, the effect once again fades to insigniﬁcance. Because we estimate LPMs, the coefﬁcients are directly interpretable as probabilistic marginal effects. Accordingly, based on our ﬁve prior contributor speciﬁcations, our results indicate that when all ﬁve prior contributors opt to conceal their identity, a subsequent contributor is 12% more likely to conceal their identity. Similarly, when all ﬁve prior contributors opt to conceal their contribution amounts, our results indicate that a subsequent visitor is 6.7% more likely to do so as well. It is important to point out here that we see no direct evidence of cross-behavioral effects when it comes to concealment. That is, prior others’ amount hiding has no signiﬁcant association with a focal contributors’ identity hiding, and prior others identity hiding has no signiﬁcant association with focal contributors’ amount hiding. If our results were attributable to correlated unobservables relating to a general decline in campaign quality perceptions, we might expect that both types of concealment occurring in tandem, yet we do not. Regardless, to rule out the inﬂuence of correlated unobservables, we conduct

a set of instrumental variable estimations as part of our robustness checks, to provide further support. 6.2. Contribution Next, we proceed to the analysis of our second hypothesis, about the effect of prior others’ hiding behavior on subsequent fundraising outcomes—i.e., the probability of conversion and expected contributions, conditional on conversion, for subsequent visitors. The results of our corner solution (Tobit) estimation are provided in Table 6.11 By contrast to our LPMs, it is less straightforward to obtain marginal effect estimates of identity hiding in our Tobit (two-part model) regressions, which are comprised of a decision to participate and the “amount” of participation conditional on the decision to participate. As described by Lee (2009), the observed coefﬁcient reﬂects a presumed latent effect, jointly comprised of effects on the participation and conditional participation decisions. Accordingly, we separately estimate the marginal effect of prior others’ identity concealing on a subsequent visitors’ probability of contribution—P (y > 0 x)—and the expected

contribution amount of a subsequent visitor, conditional on contributing some amount—E (y y > 0 x). Calculating these effects, we ﬁnd that when ﬁve prior contributors collectively conceal their identities, a subsequent campaign visitor is 2% less likely to contribute to a campaign, and we ﬁnd only a slightly weaker effect when considering only the most recent prior contributor (1.8%). Moreover, following ﬁve anonymous contributions, even if the next visitor decides to contribute, they contribute 6% ($4.89) less to a campaign, on average. Once again, the effect when considering only the most recent prior contributor is only slightly weaker; visitors following a single anonymous contributor supply $4.48 less to a campaign, on average. If we extrapolate these results to the platform level, the economic signiﬁcance of identity hiding is clear. As noted previously, identity hiding was observed in approximately 12% of all positive contributions in our sample (20,162 observations). A simple, naïve calculation based on effect estimates associated with the models focusing on peer effects from only the most recent prior contributor would suggest that the reduction in average contributions translates to a loss of roughly $90,000 over our period of observation. If we expand the calculation to include visitors that opted not to contribute at all, the number grows further—based on a conservative

assumption that the 20,000 anonymous contributions in our sample resulted in 500 fewer converted visitors, with each supplying the average contribution amount ($95.00), lost revenue grows to nearly $140,000.12 6.3. Robustness Checks Following our main estimations, we conducted a series of robustness checks. We explored potential issues of multicollinearity and outliers, obtaining variance inﬂation factors (VIFs) for all of the variables in our models based on simple pooled OLS regressions. All values were found to be below four, which is well below the commonly accepted threshold of 10 (Kennedy 2003, p. 213), thus multicollinearity does not appear to be of great concern. To assess robustness to outliers or inﬂuential observations, we excluded those observations associated with campaigns in the top 1% of the distribution in terms of funding target or amount raised. Reestimating our models on these subsamples produced no notable differences in our coefﬁcient estimates. We next considered that amount and identity hiding are not, in fact, independent alternatives when it comes to concealment, because the choices are mutually exclusive. We therefore repeated our estimation of the concealment model using a multinomial logit estimator. These results are presented in Table 7. We again observe consistent results in that prior others’ hiding behavior exhibits a signiﬁcant association with subsequent contributor’s hiding behavior, of the same type. We also considered the possibility that including controls in our hiding models for the lagged behavior of the focal contributor might introduce biases that are common in more traditional models with lagged dependent variables (LDVs). To ensure that such biases are not impacting our results, we repeated the estimation of our two hiding models, excluding the lagged controls. On doing so, we observed consistent results. We also attempted to rule out the possibility that other unobservable dynamic aspects could be driving correlated behaviors between contributors. Although the sequence of contributions appearing in our campaign panels do not reﬂect a standard time series, in the strictest sense, we might view the series of hiding and contribution decisions among sequential contributors as a process, which in turn might be nonstationary in nature (e.g., it may be that unobservable dynamic features of the campaign produce

an unobserved trend that shifts the baseline likelihood of hiding or the expected amount of a contribution, producing false correlations in our regressions). Bearing this potential in mind, and to gain a sense of whether dynamic unobservables might be at play, we began by conducting statistical tests of stationarity (unit root tests) in the hiding and contribution sequences of our campaign panels. A useful discussion of stationarity tests is provided by Coakley et al. (2006). The basic logic underlying this analysis in our setting is that a nonstationary time series can produce spurious signiﬁcance in time series regressions. That autocorrelation may be attributable to unobserved, latent trends. In our setting, one such “trend” might arise from dynamic unobserved heterogeneity related to the campaign (e.g., variations in perceived campaign quality). Assessing stationarity of the hiding and contribution series thus allows us to gain a better sense of whether the observed hiding and contribution sequences are in fact (not) driven by some dynamic unobserved factor. We estimated a series of Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) tests on the 10 longest panels in our sample. The ADF test assumes a null hypothesis of nonstationarity in all panels. Given that we consider one panel at a time, a statistically signiﬁcant result enables us to reject the null of nonstationarity. Table 8 provides the results of these tests; we observe signiﬁcance in every case, allowing us to conclude that each of the series are stationary processes. We next leveraged historical data on contributor behaviors in prior contributions to other campaigns, as dynamic behavioral instruments. That is, we instrument for a prior contributor’s contribution and hiding behavior using the lagged behavior of that same individual, exhibited in contributions they have made to completely different crowdfunding campaigns, as was explained in Section 5.3. We begin by repeating our LPMs for identity and amount hiding, employing 2SLS. For the sake of tractability, we focus on the most basic model, which

looks at only the most recent prior contributor. As noted above, we do so because expanding the consideration set to ﬁve prior contributors reduces our available sample to just 585 observations and, similarly, expanding the consideration set to 10 prior contributors reduces our available sample to 0 observations. The results of the estimations for identity and amount hiding are presented in Table 9, columns 1 and 2. Our instruments appear quite strong (Angrist– Pischke ﬁrst-stage Chi-square statistics are all signiﬁcant at p < 0 01, as are ﬁrst-stage F statistics), and we also see that the effect of prior others’ hiding on a subsequent contributor’s hiding remains stable with the application of our instruments. Following the above, we estimate our instrumental variable Tobit regression, using the same set of instruments. The results of this estimation are presented in Table 10. Again observe that our instruments are quite strong. We also see that prior others’ identity

hiding behavior is signiﬁcantly (negatively) associated with subsequent visitors’ expected contributions. Taken together, our various robustness checks collectively support the validity of our initial ﬁndings. Finally, we considered that a homophily argument might still hold under our instrumental setup, particularly in our hiding models, where we model sequential positive correlation around a particular behavior, across contributors. It may be the case that individuals who are similar to one another arrive at the campaign at similar points in time, for similar reasons, and exhibit similar behavior. Our instrument is deﬁned in terms of persistent behavior on the part of contributors, over time. As such, a spurious correlation in behavior might still manifest because of static homophily. To address this possibility, we ﬁrst reestimated our hiding models, this time incorporating contributor ﬁxed effects (rather than campaign ﬁxed effects). If homophily were the primary driver of the signiﬁcant effect from prior others’ hiding on a focal contributor’s hiding, then we would expect that effect to fade to insigniﬁcance upon controlling for all static features of the contributor. Put another way, if the observed hiding behavior is driven by the contributor’s characteristics, which are correlated with those of the prior contributor, and their hiding behavior in turn, then controlling for those characteristics should address the spurious relationship. As can be seen in Table 11, however, we observe consistent results upon introducing contributor ﬁxed effects.13 This implies,
13 Repeating this process with our instrumental variable speciﬁcation produces similar results. This, in turn, implies that while behavior is sticky across observations, it is by no means completely static. A descriptive analysis of variation in the hiding decisions

in turn, that our results are not attributable to static homophily. The above results help to rule out the possibility that homophily drives sequential correlation in information concealment across contributors. However, it remains possible that homophily drives the negative association between information hiding and subsequent declines in conversion rates or contribution amounts. This could occur, for example, if individuals who tend to conceal information are also more likely to delay or withhold their contributions (e.g., being risk averse). To address this possibility, we looked at the simple correlation between the sequence in which a contributor typically arrives to a campaign (on average), and the tendency with which an individual conceals information in their transactions. Interestingly, we observe the opposite association. That is, we observe a negative correlation ( = −0 037) between the “lateness” of arrival and a contributor’s propensity to conceal information. When we further limited our analysis to repeat contributors, the negative correlation grows much stronger ( = −0 106 for two or more contributions, and = −0 194 for three or more contributions). This observation is also consistent with the ﬁndings of Peacey and Saunders (2014), who analyze anonymizing behavior in online charitable donations to the London Marathon and note that the earliest donors are the most likely to anonymize themselves, particularly the very ﬁrst donor. Given all of the above, homophily does not appear to be a likely explanation for our results around conversion and contribution.
of repeat contributors tells a similar story; we observe that more than 20% of repeat contributors exhibit variation in hiding behavior across transactions, and this fraction increases to ~30% when we consider only those who contributed three or more times.

Discussion and Conclusion

The results of our study have important implications for practice, policy, and website design, both for crowdfunding and online social venues more broadly. Understanding the motivations of a user base is key to designing the hosting platform. It would appear that individuals’ decisions to conceal information might have both positive and negative impacts on their utility. Contributors are likely to manipulate the information control features without considering the inﬂuence that their decision may have on subsequent others. In particular, it appears that a decision to conceal information negatively impacts later campaign fundraising, which runs counter to the contributor’s interests. This implies that platform purveyors would do well to consider the ancillary impacts of providing information control mechanisms to users, which are likely to be context speciﬁc, and plan to address them accordingly. An ideal ﬁrst step would be to mitigate the initial emergence of concealment. Fortunately, in this regard, recent work notes that even slight modiﬁcations to website design can result in signiﬁcant changes to user behavior, impacting, for example, participation and the quality of user contributions in collective settings (Jung et al. 2010). In the present context, one possible approach to mitigating concealing behavior without risking a reduction in contributor participation might be to offer explicit, nonmonetary incentives to contributors for revealing (e.g., recognition). It is worth noting the recent work of Burtch et al. (2015), who studied the individual effect of randomly reducing access to information controls for some users, by delaying their presentation until after contributor payment. Those authors found that this resulted in greater overall campaign fundraising, and they suggest that this happens because the information controls prime contributors with privacy concerns, reducing conversion rates. Although it is not clear what the long-term impacts of information control removal might be, taken in tandem with the results we report here, on the peer effects that manifest from crowdfunders’ information control usage, it seems that anonymity mechanisms may be largely detrimental in reward-based crowdfunding. Regardless, further study is necessary to understand moderating factors that may play a role in the identiﬁed relationships—e.g., campaign or contributor characteristics. Our work presents, what is to our knowledge, a ﬁrst attempt to evaluate individuals’ use of information hiding mechanisms at the transaction level, to conceal discrete behaviors, in a real-world setting. Whereas past work has explored individuals’ behavior in response to exogenously imposed anonymity,

or the mere provision of information control mechanisms, here we consider a user’s endogenous decision to conceal information associated with themselves and a speciﬁc action they have undertaken. We also provide a ﬁrst empirical attempt to understand the dynamic inﬂuence of individuals’ information hiding decisions in speciﬁc transactions, and we have done so in a novel, economic context—the burgeoning industry of online crowdfunding. That being said, the results of our empirical analysis need to be understood in light of some limitations. First, our data do not allow us to observe the characteristics or identity of visitors who ultimately chose not to contribute. Accordingly, we treat all unconverted visits as independent observations when, in reality, it is possible that multiple visits are attributable to the same user, whose repeated visits reﬂect a growing interest in the campaign, before they ultimately choose to contribute. Future work can look to address this issue through alternative means of data collection, such as a laboratory experiment. Alternatively, future work might circumvent this issue through improved data collection (e.g., the use of browser cookies). Additionally, it is worth noting that our chosen instruments are undeﬁned when a prior contributor has not previously contributed elsewhere on the platform, within our period of observation. Although it is possible that the arrival of new (rather than experienced) users may be nonrandom, and thus that our sample may be biased by this choice of instrument in some way, we would note two things that mitigate this concern. First, repeat contributors reportedly supply the majority of money on reward-based crowdfunding platforms (∼65% of the dollars contributed on Kickstarter are supplied by repeat contributors).14 This suggests that our sample represents the most important segment of the user base on rewardbased crowdfunding platforms. Second, the results of our instrumental variable analyses are consistent with our uninstrumented regressions, and the magnitude of the key estimates is actually larger. This suggests that new (or one-time) contributors are not the source of our primary result. Given the above, we believe that this censoring therefore may place bounds on the conclusions we are able to draw about crowdfunder behavior at large, but those bounds do not appear to be overly restrictive. Additionally, it should be noted that, whereas our contribution model incorporates an observation for every campaign visitor, regardless of their decision to contribute, and thus avoids issues of selection, our

495 also to elaborate on our understanding of the decision to conceal one’s identity or behaviors in online crowdfunding. Given crowdfunding’s signiﬁcant economic potential and recent growth as an industry, any increases in welfare or marketplace efﬁciency that can be achieved through modiﬁcations to the design of these platforms or their policies should be pursued wholeheartedly, yet also with caution. Our work presents a solid ﬁrst step in informing those efforts. It is our hope that this work will therefore provide insights to scholars and practitioners, informing design, as well as policy and regulation going forward (Stock and Yogo 2002). Acknowledgments

hiding models do not. This is because the hiding decision is undeﬁned when a contribution does not take place. This is important, because it is conceivable that a selection effect is at play in our hiding estimations. Unfortunately, we are hindered by the fact that we lack sufﬁcient variables to reliably estimate a ﬁrststage selection equation. However, in this regard, our approach is not unlike that of a number of other recent studies of online crowdfunding and charitable donation that aim to identify peer effects (Burtch et al. 2013, Herzenstein et al. 2011, Kim and Viswanathan 2014, Peacey and Saunders 2014, Smith et al. 2015, Zhang and Liu 2012). Indeed, our access to data about noncontributing visitors arguably allows us to go farther, particularly insofar as this enables us to avoid selection issues in our contribution models. Moreover, selection is unlikely to pose a direct threat to the validity of our hiding estimates, because we have no reason to expect that individuals who select out of contribution would be systematically more likely to reveal themselves had they chosen to contribute. Finally, we acknowledge that there is an alternative, plausible mechanism for the observed peer effects in the information hiding decision. In particular, it is possible that hiding begets hiding because of awareness or learning effects, rather than because of a normative inﬂuence. That is, perhaps the peer effect manifests because observers become aware of the information control feature, or learn about its operation, when others are observed using it. Nonetheless, we believe that descriptive norms are likely to play the primary role. This is because a learning or awareness mechanism would be expected to produce a speciﬁc, dominant pattern of variation in hiding behavior within an individual (from revealing to hiding over time, but not the other way around). We do not observe this in our data. Furthermore, at the time of our study, individuals were prompted with a very clear, prominent radio button, asking them if they would like to conceal any information, as part of the contribution process, and the user would be informed of the implications of their choice via a dynamically updated display of how the contribution would be recorded and displayed to others. As such, it is unlikely that a subject would be unaware of the mechanism or how it operates. Our work provides some insight into the drivers of endogenous selection into anonymity and its consequences for other users of crowdfunding platforms. However, there are a variety of factors that are likely to inﬂuence this decision, of which peer inﬂuence is but one. It is our hope that future work can expand on the analyses we undertake here, to understand analogous processes in other online settings, and
