EMPIRICAL RESEARCH

Factors influencing the intention to comply with data protection regulations in hospitals: based on gender differences in behaviour and deterrence
Abstract German hospitals are required to comply with, and give due consideration to, the data protection laws and regulations that apply to their daily work. However, the data protection scandals that have occurred in Germany in recent years imply that this compliance on the part of hospital employees cannot be taken for granted. According to the literature available, psychological factors may account for this fact – in particular the variables of the theory of planned behaviour and the general deterrence theory. In keeping with these theories, this research has analysed the influences of the attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control on employees’ intentions to comply with data protection regulations. A survey was conducted among hospital employees in Germany to further identify the most significant factors influencing their intention to comply with data protection and the variance in intention between men and women. The results suggest that psychological factors such as attitude, subjective norms and perceived behaviour control are significantly influential and find significant differences between the genders in the intention to comply with data protection regulations. The results of this study demonstrate that there are practical implications that, if implemented, can lead to a higher standard of data protection compliance in hospitals in the future by taking the technical and organisational measures of awareness for data protection compliance into account.

Introduction
Data protection regulations for the health-care industry in Germany are enshrined in general laws, such as the Federal Law for Data Protection and the Telecommunication Act, as well as in industry-speciﬁc regulations and policies. Special laws and ordinances like the Social Security Code and patient/physician conﬁdentiality regulations are in place to protect patient information and other related medical data. Every employee is legally obligated to maintain provisions for the privacy of data which is – ﬁrst and foremost – subject to the patient/physician conﬁdentiality regulations within the hospital (this also applies to non-medical personnel, as it concerns the provision of medical treatment, cf. StGB (German Penal Code) Section 203, Chapter 3).

In spite of the existence of such data protection laws and regulations (Banisar & Davies, 1999) which aim to ensure the protection of sensitive data, the number of data breaches has increased in recent years. The number of well-known data protection scandals (see a list of data protection scandals at http://www.projekt-datenschutz.de) and the prevalence of data abuses in virtually all of Germany’s branches of business imply that data protection laws and regulations may not be sufﬁcient to ensure the protection of person-related data. In contrast, 19% of U.S. health-care providers indicated that their organisation had experienced a security breach in 2013 (Annual HIMSS Leadership Survey, 2013). In comparison to other industries, health care is considered to be especially vulnerable due to the particular sensitivity of the personal data handled therein (sensitive data according to the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) Part 3, Chapter 9, Section 42a). This vulnerability is demonstrated by the statistic that states that 14% of all data security incidents reported for 2006 occurred in the health-care industry (Symantec, 2007, current publications of data protection scandals found at http:// www.datenschutzskandale.de and http://www.projektdatenschutz.de (in German)). According to these ﬁgures, the health-care industry ranks third among the top industries that are affected by data abuse (following public administration and the education system). In one particular data security incident, 5800 employees at the University Hospital in Hamburg–Eppendorf UKE scandal around patient documents, http://www .mopo.de/news/aerger-an-der-uni-klinik-uke-skandalum-kranken-daten,5066732,5246894.html, 20 February 2009 (accessed 13 July 2015) were given extensive access rights, which resulted in the loss of electronic patient documents. These documents were illegally published by employees. Patient documents from many other German hospitals (Patient documents on the Internet, http:// www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/wib/1310932/, 20 October 2008) (accessed 13 July 2015) were made publicly accessible via the Internet and hard drives containing patient data went missing from the Lüdenscheid hospital (two hard-drives containing sensitive patient data went missing from Märkischen (Lüdenscheid.) A data storage device was found by a passerby in inner-city Iserlohn. Patient data misses, http://www.derwesten.de/ wr/wr-info/patientendaten-vermisst-id348653.html, 03.06 .3009 (accessed 13 July 2015). These incidents are crucial examples of the increasing risk of data security violations taking place, especially in hospitals in Germany. Since the mere existence of laws and internal regulations do not appear to be sufﬁcient to prevent such leaks, other factors may need to be considered in order to ensure employee compliance with data protection regulations. The laws and regulations that are currently accepted do not require obligatory mechanisms (Würtenberger, 1999). Employees’ general acceptance and awareness of the importance of data protection regulations and the widespread implementation of technical precautions, measures

and systems are essential for the maintenance of privacy in hospitals. Data protection is a basic human right (Westin, 1967; Altmann, 1976). In patient care there are occasionally situations that arise in which employees are unaware of the importance of the data protection regulations that are in place for the protection of their patients. Failure to follow data protection regulations has been reported as a problem in situations related to patient information (Athlin et al, 1992; Bouchard, 1993). In the literature, there is a general consensus that employees are the weakest link in the chain of information security, which is similar to data protection. Psychological factors play an essential role in determining the intention of employees to comply with data protection regulations in hospitals. The severity of the penalties in place for non-compliance, the awareness of detection certainty and the technical equipment assumed to support the data protection regulations, and the opinions of others are factors that inﬂuence a person’s intention to comply with data protection regulations. So far, these factors have not yet been identiﬁed as inﬂuencing hospital employees’ compliance with data protection regulations. Therefore, it is essential to determine which factors have the most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the behaviour of employees in order to use these results to create measures that will increase compliance with, and acceptance of, data protection in health care. In addition, the gendered differences in the intention to comply are relevant to this study because, in German hospitals, the majority of nurses (87%) are female while the majority of doctors (62%) are male (Statistisches Bundesamt Deutschland, 2008). Gender differences have not previously been studied in the context of the intention to comply with data protection regulations, despite the fact that Anderson & Agarwal (2010) have found that gender has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on behavioural intention as it applies to information security. In the literature on compliance with information security, psychological factors have also taken a prominent role in explaining the factors that inﬂuence the intention to comply with regulations. Of the many potentially relevant psychological factors, variables from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the general deterrence theory (GDT) were used to analyse the inﬂuential factors for information security compliance in the present research. As these variables contribute to the explanation of compliance in the context of information security, they may also be relevant to data protection. All European countries have data protection laws based on Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995. Studies performed on information security in the United States or other non-European countries are not based on the level of compliance with the laws. As Germany has the strictest data protection laws in Europe, it presents an excellent case study for the ﬁrst stages of this study’s research into data protection compliance intention.

This study deﬁnes behavioural intention from the perspective of the TPB and considers the ‘intention to comply with data protection regulations’ as the key dependent variable in relation to the independent variables which are: attitude (the individual’s feeling about performing the behaviour for data protection compliance); the subjective norm (the inﬂuence of other people and other measures to perform for data protection compliance); and the perceived behavioural control (the perceived ease or difﬁculty in performing the behaviour) in overall compliance with the regulations for data protection. Thus, we posed two research questions: 1. What are the signiﬁcant psychological factors that inﬂuence employees’ intentions to comply with data protection regulations in hospitals? 2. Are there any differences in the factors that inﬂuence female and male hospital employees? First and foremost, this paper combines the GDT and the TPB in order to test an integrated model showing the intention to comply with data protection regulations. In addition, the study evaluates the effect of the inﬂuencing factors on the intention to comply with data protection regulations and the differences present in relation to gender. Our integrated model is valuable for understanding individual intention in a more holistic manner.

Literature review
Information security, which is similar to data protection, was often discussed during the research stage in terms of the TPB and the technology acceptance model. These models are not used, however, in previous research on the inﬂuencing factors that apply to the intention to comply with data protection regulations. Also gender differences were not considered in the context of information security or data protection in other studies. In their study using the technology acceptance model in e-mail usage, Gefen & Straub (1997) found that women and men differ in their perceptions and concluded that researchers should include gender in IT diffusion models. With the technology acceptance model, Awad & Ragowsky (2008) found signiﬁcant differences between men and women in their use of e-commerce systems. Because of the importance of behavioural aspects in data protection, the focus of this research is on information security. Information security is not strongly regulated by laws, but often by internal regulations and policies instead. No other data protection laws in the world compare to the level of European regulations, but the framework for compliance with the regulations of data protection and information security is similar worldwide and compliance behaviour for information security and data protection is important for all organisations – particularly health-care organisations. Herath & Rao (2009) examined employee compliance behaviour in terms of security regulations and guidelines. The main hypothesis of Herath and Rao’s study was based

on the fact that attitudes towards policies in information security are positive inﬂuences on employees’ intentions to comply with security policies. Their study was based on Taylor & Todd’s (1995) decomposed theory of planned behaviour (DTPB) (Taylor & Todd (1995) proposed decomposing the constructs of TPB into detailed components. The DTPB expands the TPB by including additional factors as independent variables to the subjective norm (SN), perceived behavioural control (BC) and attitude (AT)), the protection motivation theory (PMT), and the GDT. Their results suggested that the employee’s perception of security breaches, the effectiveness of their actions in following the security policies and their self-efﬁcacy in following the security policies are most likely to affect policy compliance. Deviations from total compliance were discovered in the day-to-day work routine and sanctions were deemed ineffective in facilitating compliance behaviour. The availability of required resources signiﬁcantly enhanced employees’ abilities to perform the security related actions required of them. The results of this study prove that variables from these theories do, in fact, contribute to the prediction for compliance with information security, and can, therefore, also be considered relevant in explaining data protection compliance. Although Herath and Rao included gender as a demographic factor, the differences in the variables for gender were not analysed. On the basis of the model of the TPB in Bulgurcu’s study (2008), the intention to comply with information security policies showed similar results in the value of the variable attitude as an independent variable in the intention to comply with security policies, as in the study of Herath & Rao (2009). These results were conﬁrmed in Bulgurcu et al’s (2010) study of relationality-based beliefs and information security awareness. Their results suggested that an employee’s intention to comply with information security policies is signiﬁcantly and positively inﬂuenced by normative belief (the perceived social pressure to comply with requirements stemming from behavioural expectations suggested by the behaviour of other employees or higher-ranking colleagues), self-efﬁcacy and general attitude towards compliance. According to these results, these variables can also be of interest in creating a model aimed at analysing inﬂuential psychological factors and the differences in gender (which were not analysed by Bulgurcu et al) in data protection compliance intention. Chan et al (2005) analysed the effects of social factors on employees’ compliance with organisational security policies. Their results suggested that compliant behaviour could be promoted by increasing employees’ self-efﬁcacy and by enhancing employees’ perception of the information security climate. The inﬂuence of the behaviour demonstrated by management personnel and socialisation among co-workers wields a signiﬁcant effect on users’ perceptions of information security, which in turn positively inﬂuences their security policy compliance behaviour. Self-efﬁcacy and actions based on the perceived approval of others may also differ when related to gender, which could be an additional variation in the inﬂuence

behaviour involving data protection regulations and should therefore be analysed further. That the awareness of threats posed by negative technologies (those that are designed to disrupt or harm their users, such as computer viruses, spyware and tools for breaking into systems and databases) has a signiﬁcant impact on users’ behavioural intention towards the use of security technologies was found by Dinev & Hu (2007) in their study in which user behavioural intentions towards protective technologies were analysed based on the framework of the TPB (Ajzen, 1988) and the theory of technology acceptance (Davis, 1989). The inﬂuence of the subjective norm – the impact presented by the opinions of an employee’s peer who is held in high esteem – shows signiﬁcant differences between the user groups (advanced technology users vs basic technology users). The determinants ‘perceived ease of use’ and ‘computer self-efﬁcacy’ (based on the DTPB) were found to be insigniﬁcant in the context of protective technologies. The inﬂuence that others have on the behaviour and the differentiation among user groups are also relevant criteria for assessing data protection compliance. The value of motivation and the relevance of data protection for the work of hospital employees may be factors that inﬂuence data protection compliance intention. Albrechtsen (2007) hypothesised that a major problem associated with employees following regulations in information security work is the lack of motivation and recognition of the relevance of information security to their work. The study (2007) suggested – according to users’ opinions of information security – that the users’ tasks predominantly fell outside of information security, which they deemed preferable. The results indicate a discrepancy in the level of motivation for information security work as stated by employees and the actual performance of their individual security actions and show that a heavy workload in information security creates a conﬂict of interest between functionality and information security. To analyse in the context of data protection compliance, the level of motivation for information security work and individual security actions in this qualitative study will be reproduced by using the self-efﬁcacy (SE), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use variables (EU) taken from the DTPB. Researchers have evaluated many aspects that they suggest may have an inﬂuence on more security-conscious behaviours. For instance, the effect of perceived certainty and severity of sanctions on the intentional misuse of information security has been theoretically modelled in an empirical study by D’Arcy & Hovav (2004), based on the GDT. They found that the effect of deterrent security measures is an increase in the perceived certainty and severity of sanctions, which in turn leads to the intentional misuse of information security, including behaviours that are illegal, inappropriate and unethical in the context of information security. The results also show that gender modiﬁes the effect of deterrent security countermeasures on both perceived certainty and severity of sanctions. Compared with women, men will

perceive less certainty and a lower level in the severity of sanctions in response to deterrent security countermeasures. The perceived certainty and severity of sanctions of the GDT are interesting variables that could be used in our model for analysing the inﬂuential factors in data protection compliance. Pahnila et al (2007) found that employee attitudes towards complying with information security policies, normative beliefs and routines greatly affect their overall intention to comply with information security policies. Sanctions are insigniﬁcant in affecting employees’ intentions to comply with information security policy and rewards do not have a signiﬁcant effect on actual compliance with information security policy. Sanctions and the attitude to comply with data protection can be also relevant to data protection compliance. In her study, Hayn (2005) examined the implementation of the requirements for data protection laws in the LKH University Hospital in Graz, based on the checklist for data protection in hospitals provided by the Independent Centre for Data Protection in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany (checklist ‘Datenschutz im Krankenhaus’ Independent Federal State Center for Data Protection Schleswig-Holstein (ULD), https://www.datenschutzzentrum. de/medizin/krankenh/checkliste-patientendatenschutz. pdf (German)). Although the checklist draws inspiration from German federal sanctions, nearly all test points were applicable to the university hospital in Graz, Austria. It is yet to be determined how successfully the guidelines have been implemented into employees’ daily interaction with patients under their current working conditions and where there may be potential for improvement. Also to be considered are the opportunities for sharpening the employees’ awareness of data protection. Many references are made by Hayn to Peissl’s (2003) work on the principles of data protection and their implementation in the medical industry which also relies on the implementation of the requirements for legal provisions. This demonstrates that although all the necessary subject areas in the hospital that are relevant for data protection were recognised as such, the requirements for implementation were obviously unfulﬁlled. Measures pertaining to improvement were deﬁned as requirements, to ensure employee compliance with data protection laws and their legal obligation to protect patient data. The reasons for these deﬁciencies were not explained or examined by Hayn. The causes for shortcomings in the target speciﬁcations were usually attributed to technical, structural or organisational ﬂaws. Among the various factors in compliance with policies in information system security, those such as perceived vulnerability, self-efﬁcacy, and attitudes towards subjective norms, compliance and response efﬁcacy have been found to have a positive inﬂuence over employees’ intentions for compliance, according to Iﬁnedo (2012). Iﬁnedo’s three variables for analysing this inﬂuence – self-efﬁcacy (SE), subjective norms (SN) and attitude (AT) – can be applied to the context of data protection compliance in our study.

Compliance with data protection laws in Germany is mostly taught through awareness measures that indicate the legal requirements for, and demonstrate the potential criminal consequences of, noncompliance. Only through the reference to laws (Würtenberger, 1999), not the threat of punishment (Herath & Rao, 2009), is able to cause a behavioural change in to the intention to comply with regulations. Knowing the factors that inﬂuence the behaviour to comply with data protection regulations is important, as is the understanding of the differences between the genders in relation to these factors. Only when armed with these results can awareness measures be deﬁned and used in order to inﬂuence the behaviours that underpin the tendency to comply with regulations. Much research has been done to test these inﬂuencing factors by using the TPB and the GDT models, but using an integrated model for testing data protection compliance intention was not used. All these factors may have a signiﬁcant impact on the data protection compliance intention because of the similarities between information security and data protection. In this context, the gender differential was also analysed in the model in order to ﬁnd the signiﬁcance of gender-inﬂuence on the intention to comply with data protection regulations.

Theoretical background
As mentioned above, variables from the TPB (Ajzen, 1991) and factors from the GDT (Williams & Hawkins, 1986) are often referenced in publications on compliance with information security policies (Pahnila et al, 2007). In a recent literature review, Lebek et al (2013) analysed the applied theories for information security awareness and behaviour where the TPB and the GDT are found as the most frequently used models. As the author of the present paper deems these variables to be relevant in the context of data protection compliance, these approaches will be brieﬂy introduced below. The TBP (Ajzen, 1991), an extension of the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980), is one of the most commonly applied behavioural theories used to explain an individual’s intention to perform speciﬁc behaviours. To be more speciﬁc, the TPB posits that individual behaviour is driven by behavioural intentions which are a function of that individual’s attitude towards the behaviour. In addition, the theory postulates that individual behaviour is also inﬂuenced by the subjective norms deﬁned as the performance of the behaviour and the individual's perception of the ease with which the behaviour can be performed (behavioural control) (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). The theory claims that behavioural intention can be explained by three antecedents: attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control (Ajzen, 1991). Taylor & Todd (1995) applied the TBP to the ﬁeld of information technology in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the behaviours relating to the secure use of information technologies. The variables of the TPB are

suitable for integration into a model that can be used to analyse data protection compliance intention, because the assessment of one’s own behaviour and the attitudes of other employees are also likely to affect data protection compliance intention. The GDT postulates that it is possible to prevent people from committing antisocial acts by using countermeasures such as strict disincentives and sanctions in proportion to the act (Straub & Welke, 1998). Employees sometimes fail to follow security procedures which can lead to the loss or destruction of data as well as to the exposure of the overall integrity of that data. In the context of the GDT, countermeasures could be established to negate such a threat or at least to lessen the potential risk in the event of an employee making a mistake (Detection and Punishment). Deterrence has been proved to play a role in reducing negative behaviour and has also been found to be an effective mechanism in governance. The deterrence theory suggests that unwanted behaviour can be deterred by a certain, severe and/or swift threat of punishment (Williams & Hawkins, 1986). Laws and regulations specify the possible penalties in cases of detected violations of data protection. In terms of data protection compliance, these factors were not previously considered in the literature as inﬂuences on behaviour and are therefore suitable for inclusion in our model. In addition, the differences between the sexes were analysed in order to identify men and women’s different intentions to comply with data protection regulations.

Model and hypotheses development
On the basis of the theories as well as the respective ﬁndings from previous studies, the author built a model (Figure 1) regarding the data protection compliance of hospital staff. In this study we deﬁne data protection compliance (DI) as the employee’s intention to accept and follow the laws and regulations for data protection, based on the deﬁnition of behavioural intention taken from the TPB (Ajzen, 1991) as marking the indication of an individual’s readiness to perform a given behaviour. As can be gathered from the literature review above, the variables from the TPB and the GDT are deemed especially important in this context. This model was applied to all participants in order to determine the relevance of the variables. In addition, gender was examined as a factor inﬂuencing the variables. The intention to comply with data protection regulations is relevant to all industries. The German data protection scandals, as described in the introduction, revealed that the health-care industry is consistently among the top ranking industries to experience data security breaches (Symantec, 2007). Hospitals depend heavily on their employees to ensure data protection, because employees who access sensitive data and utilise IT resources assume a certain role and responsibility for protecting this data. Researchers in the ﬁeld of information security have examined the factors

that inﬂuence employee behaviour in performing these roles and meeting their responsibilities (Peace et al, 2003; Riemenschneider et al, 2003; Anderson, 2005; Chan et al, 2005; Herath & Rao, 2009). The three main constructs of the TPB were adopted into our model with the following variables: attitude (AT), subjective norms (SN) and the perceived behavioural control (BC). Attitude is deﬁned as the individual’s positive or negative feelings about performing the target behaviour (data protection compliance) (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975, p. 216) and inﬂuences the intention to comply with the data protection regulations. The subjective norms (SN) are deﬁned as the employee’s perception of peer approval of the behaviour in question – this can come from other employees, supervisors and managers who are highly regarded by the employee (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975, p. 302; Ajzen, 1991). User behaviour in protecting privacy is inﬂuenced by internal and external factors (Hsu & Shih, 2009). Lastly, the variable of perceived behavioural control (BC), which is deﬁned as the employee’s perceived ease or difﬁculty in performing the particular behaviour to comply with the data protection regulations (Ajzen, 1991; Taylor & Todd, 1995), is determined by the total set of accessible control beliefs; i.e. beliefs about the presence of factors (technical and organisational measures for data protection) that may facilitate or impede the employee’s performance of the behaviour. The acceptance of data protection is always a combination of the use of technical measures and personal behaviour regulated by organisational rules. Gender differences are relevant in the results found by Busch (1995). The detection certainty (DC) in the GDT is deﬁned as the act or process of discovering breaches in data protection within the hospital. Methods of discovering the violation of data protection are: accidental discovery,

discovery through internal system controls and purposeful detection activities (Williams & Hawkins, 1986; Straub & Welke, 1998). Vroom & von Solms (2004) argued that some form of evaluation is required in order to investigate the security compliance of an individual. Deterrence theory suggests that severe and certain punishments will reduce the unwanted behaviour and that potential violators should be made aware of efforts to control anti-social behaviours (Straub, 1989). Consequently, we can expect that when employees are aware of being monitored, their intention to comply with, and follow, the regulations of data protection is positively affected. Therefore, detection certainty inﬂuences the intention to comply with data protection regulations (Herath & Rao, 2009). Finally, punishment severity (PS), deﬁned as the prevention of criminal behaviour from employees due to fear (especially fear of punishment), was added to the model (Williams & Hawkins, 1986; Straub & Welke, 1998). When an employee knows that the severity of penalties for noncompliance in data protection is high, the likelihood is high that he will intentionally show a decrease in undesirable behaviour (Peace et al, 2003; Herath & Rao, 2009). Peace et al (2003) found that the severity of punishment inﬂuences employee attitudes, therefore imposing more severe penalties can deter non-adherence to security policies. Table 1 provides a brief summary of the constructs and related theories that are considered in this study. The subjective norm – in this case the value attributed to the performance of an action (Ajzen & Madden, 1986) – directly affects the intention to use as well as the actual use of the system (Mathieson, 1991). However, Venkatesh & Davis (2000) found discrepancies in the deﬁnition of the variables of use as ‘voluntary’ or ‘mandatory’ and how they are inﬂuenced by the subjective norm. In studies where

organisational regulations were concerned, employees’ perceptions of expectations held by their supervisors, managers and colleagues were examined (Karahanna et al, 1999; Venkatesh et al, 2003; Iﬁnedo, 2012) and this suggested a positive correlation between subjective norms and information security compliance. Employees that are inﬂuenced by the expectations of others are represented as independent variables in the subjective norm and inﬂuence the overall intention to comply with data protection, whereas the level of inﬂuence between men and women may be different. On the basis of these results, it is likely that the employees also accept certain provisions for data protection. Hence, we propose the following hypothesis. So far, no research is available that deals with the effects of gender on privacy compliance. Ajzen (1991) makes no reference to gender differences in the TPB. In fact, gender has been generally missing from IT behavioural research (Smith et al, 2011), with the exception of Truman and Baroudi’s (1994) study of women in the IS workplace. In Hofstede (1980), it was found that gender roles, as reﬂected in the study, are transferred through socialisation. Men are taught to be assertive and women to be nurturing. The gender differences were tested and analysed in sub-samples of men and women (to show the difference in the coefﬁcients) and as inﬂuenced by the partial least squares (PLS) analysis by using the PLS-Graph (Chin, 1998) to ﬁnd out the degree of the signiﬁcance of gender as an inﬂuence. Each hypothesis has been analysed in terms of the inﬂuence of gender in order to evaluate the difference of the intentions of men and women. In the overall results, each hypothesis will be discussed both generally and more speciﬁcally in order to include the result of gender differences. H1: Subjective norms have a positive correlation with the intention to comply with data protection regulations. The use of the resources and technology conditions to follow the data protection regulations is a fundamental basis for the protection of data in hospitals. Technology conditions (e. g. password security, encryption) and other parameters such as applicable resources (e.g., accessibility of policies or availability of help if needed) and perceived selfefﬁcacy for inﬂuencing the perceived behavioural control (BC) as an independent variable to the intention to comply with data protection regulations (DI), provide an outline for self-monitoring (Ajzen, 1991; Taylor & Todd, 1995; Venkatesh & Davis, 2000) that can positively affect

adherence to intention to comply with data protection regulations. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: H2: Perceived behaviour control positively affects a person’s intention to comply with data protection regulations.

The TPB postulates that positive attitude and subjective inﬂuence affect behavioural intention. With this model, current information security research supports this relationship (Karahanna et al, 1999; Herath & Rao, 2009; Iﬁnedo, 2012). The acceptance of the use of technical systems differs by gender (Hiroshi & Zavodny, 2005). As a result, the acceptance of technical and organisational security measures in the independent variable attitude is shown to inﬂuence the dependent variable employees’ intention to comply with data protection regulations. Thus: H3: Attitudes towards security technology and data protection regulations positively affect intention to comply with data protection regulations.

An employee’s attitude affects his or her own behaviour. Descriptive norms show the degree to which an employee takes regulations for data protection into consideration, only because s/he believes that others observe the regulations and therefore s/he also wants to meet these expectations. A meta-analytic review ﬁnds that the descriptive norm explains an additional ﬁve percent of variance over the TPB model constructs of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control, suggesting that it may be an important predictor for a variety of behavioural phenomena in social settings (Rivis & Sheeran, 2003). Venkatesh et al (2003) identiﬁed that behaviours and beliefs are often communally performed and accepted, meaning that individual employees often imitate or repeat the action or nonaction demonstrated by their professional counterparts. The subjective norm (SN) is inﬂuenced by the variable attitude (AT), because the employee’s own intention is inﬂuenced by the belief regarding others’ adherence to data protection regulations. This was found to be true in the context of adherence to policies in data protection, so we propose the following hypothesis: H4: Subjective norms will positively affect the attitude to comply with the data protection regulations.

Technical and organisational measures are necessary for the implementation of legal requirements in data protection. The impact on the behaviour of hospital employees

has an inﬂuence on the consideration of data protection regulations. The employees’ acceptance of the necessity of these measures positively affects employee behaviour with regard to information security policies (Dinev & Hu, 2007). The perceived behaviour control (BC) is inﬂuenced by the social pressure (SN) of an employee to comply with the data protection regulations or non- subjective norm. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis: H5: The ease or difﬁculty of complying with data protection regulations is inﬂuenced by the behaviour of other employees. The GDT assumes that the rise in the certainty and severity of punishment reduces misbehaviour among employees. Essentially, undesirable behaviour can be avoided by means of designated and/or strict threats of punishment (Williams & Hawkins, 1986; Akers, 1990). Ehrlich (1996) proved with an empirical study that punishment exerts a deterrence effect on offenders. In IT security, few studies have proven any effect of deterrence on the illegitimate handling of data, but, as noted by Straub (1990), deterrence measures are a useful primary strategy for reducing cases of abuse. Peace et al (2003) discovered that the acknowledgement of the imposition of penalisation for infringement and the perception of the severity of sanctions for failure to comply with regulations can account for the decrease in misconduct. If employees perceive that the severity of punishment for noncompliance is high, their intention to reduce undesired behaviour is increased. The intention to comply with data protection regulations (DI), as a dependent variable, will be inﬂuenced by the punishment severity (PS), because regulations for punishment were indicated by upper-level employees (e.g., supervisors or managers). This suggests that: H6: Severity of discretionary punishment positively affects intention to comply with data protection regulations. Peace et al (2003) stress that the existence of regulations effects few changes if the regulations are not enforced and it is possible that breaches will be discovered. In contrast, Straub (1990) assumes that publicising detailed information outlining the punishment would only alert potential perpetrators to the methods and mechanisms being used for protection, thus providing them with the means to circumvent the security measures in place. If organisations are able to detect user misbehaviour, the enforcement of penalties is possible. Kankanhalli et al (2003) postulate that ‘… deterrent efforts correspond to certainty of sanctions because the amount of such efforts directly affects the probability that information systems abusers will be caught’. Thus, it is to be expected that if users are aware of monitoring and detection efforts, and have a level of awareness that their non-compliance may be detected, they are more likely to follow the policies. The detection certainty (DC) with regulations and measures designed by others therefore inﬂuences the intention to comply with data protection regulations (DI). On the basis of this, it is suggested that:

H7:

The detection certainty of breaches of data protection affects employees’ intentions to comply with data protection regulations.

With regard to the intention to comply with data protection regulations, an employee who believes that s/ he is capable of observing policies is likely to have more positive feelings towards the data protection policies and is also more likely to comply with those regulations. The TPB presents the idea that an employee’s recognition of the fact that their behaviour is being monitored is considered to be the persuasive element among all the factors that inﬂuence his or her behaviour (Ajzen, 1991; Taylor & Todd, 1995). The inﬂuence on the own attitude (AT) to comply with data protection regulations is based on the feeling the employee has when performing or not performing an expected behaviour (BC). From this argument, we propose the following hypothesis: H8: Evaluation of own behaviour positively inﬂuences the attitude toward intention to comply with data protection regulations.

Methodology
Item development The additional content validation was completed because most of the constructs were adopted from earlier studies. Using tested and validated questions improves the reliability of results (Straub, 1989). The items were abstracted in studies concerning information security and adapted for this model (Taylor & Todd, 1995; Karahanna et al, 1999; Peace et al, 2003; Peace et al, 2003; Culnan, 2004; Anderson, 2005; Chan et al, 2005; Knapp et al, 2005; Herath & Rao, 2009) to be more speciﬁcally applied to themes related to data protection (see Appendix A). This survey was examined several times. Items were added, reworded and deleted from the pre-test. Only when panel members were in agreement regarding the clarity and validity of the test items would the online survey be prepared. Where necessary, terms were explicitly deﬁned (e.g., data protection, security policies, etc.) so that each respondent had a common understanding of terms. The speciﬁc application of all items and their sources are listed in Appendix A. In the variable attitude (AT), four items were used with a 7-point Likert (1932) scale (e.g., ‘Adopting security technologies and regulations for data protection is important’) with values ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree.’ This Likert scale was applied to all other items as well. For the perceived behavioural control (BC), two items (e.g., ‘The data protection policies hinder me in my daily work’) were used for analysing the effect on the observance of data protection regulations, referring to the perceived ease or difﬁculty of performing the behaviour. In the variable subjective norm (SN), ﬁve items (e.g., ‘The upper level management of our hospital thinks I should follow organizational data protection policies’) were used to examine cases of inﬂuence in

terms of employees’ expectations of each other. Where one employee has high expectations regarding his co-worker’s adherence to data protection regulations, the variable subjective norm is used to examine whether that inﬂuences an employee’s compliance behaviour towards data protection legislation. The variable punishment severity (PS) from the GDT (e.g., ‘The hospital carries out disciplinary action with employees who break data protection rules’) examined the effect of adherence to data protection regulations by three items. Two items of the GDT were also added to the detection certainty (DC) (e.g., ‘If I violate hospital data protection policies, I would probably be caught’) for analysing the inﬂuence on the behaviour of an employee by the probability of detection in breaches of data protection. The data protection compliance intention (DI) used three items in this model for the analysis of (e.g., ‘I am likely to follow organizational data protection policies’) the inﬂuencing factors in data protection compliance intention.

Measures and study samples Data was collected from staff in German hospitals by means of paper and pencil, as well as through the use of an online questionnaire (Foth et al, 2012). The entire survey comprises 19 items in 6 sub-scales (see Appendix A) that were selected for this study from the TPB and the GDT. Additional variables were surveyed (gender, age, employment sector and seniority) and used to analyse the data in separate groups. The type of hospital was also surveyed (public, private, non-proﬁt) in order to analyse its potential inﬂuence. Five hundred and ﬁfty-seven surveys (a quotient (RQ) of 27.8%) were returned out of all paper and online surveys that were distributed. Nineteen out of the 26 hospitals that participated are public, 6 private and 1 non-proﬁt. The quotient of 557 surveys is a sufﬁcient sample base for analysing the inﬂuential factors in this model (Legris et al, 2003). A total of 63.1% (N = 349) of the participants are female and 36.9% (N = 204) male. According to the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce (2008), of the total number of employees in hospitals in Germany, 71% are female and 29% male, which means that the ratio shown in this study is representative of the national average. The largest occupational group to respond was employees working in nursing positions which accounted for 33.3% of respondents (N = 182), which closely correlates with the federal statistic of 32%. The proportion of doctors represented in the study was 19.2% (N = 105), which is also in keeping with the German Federal Statistical Ofﬁce (2008) percentage of 16%. The group categorised as administration (N = 157, 28.7%) includes all non-medical departments (logistics, technical services, home services, etc.). The category ‘other health professions’ (N = 103, 18.8%) includes medical assistants, physical therapists and others.

The results shown according to hospital types are: 44.7% public hospitals (documented in the federal statistics: 31.9%), 31% private hospitals (documented in the federal statistics: 30%) and 24.3% listed as non-proﬁt institutions (documented in the federal statistics: 37%). The participants range in age from 18 to 63 (average 42.39 years), which is considered normal. The years spent in the employ of the hospitals ranged from 1 to 46 (average 12.65 years). These values are also relevant in generating the hypotheses for data compliance among personnel in terms of demographics. The component-based partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach was used for evaluating the psychometric properties of measurement scales and testing the research hypotheses proposed in this study. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is a second-generation causal modelling statistical technique that was developed by Wold in 1982 and used for data analysis. There are many advantages to using PLS-SEM over traditional statistical methods including regression. First, it is not limited to data having multivariate normal distributions and interval scales (Wold, 1982). This makes PLS-SEM suitable for handling manipulated constructs. Also, PLS-SEM is capable of simultaneously testing the measurement model and the structural model to generate a more thorough analysis for the relationships in the model. Finally, it is generally more appropriate for testing theories in the early stages of development (Bagozzi & Fornell, 1982). In the last 25 years, the way PLS-SEM had been used shows that it had found a wider use and acquired a greater importance (Ringle et al, 2012). In the examination of the inﬂuencing factors within data protection compliance, the PLSSEM was deemed appropriate for analysing the data collated in this study and useful for explaining the effects of the model.

Instrument validation
The construct reliability, convergent reliability and the discriminate reliability were examined in the measurement model. The construct reliability is used to measure the degree to which single items are free of random error and are reliable for providing consistent in results. Composites of these reliability scores are used to qualify the reliability of the constructs. Exceeding the 0.70 threshold, the composite reliability (see Appendix B) was considered to be acceptable for all constructs (Gefen et al, 2000). Convergent validity is an indicator of conformity among multiple items. If PLS indicators are much higher on one hypothesised factor than on the others, (i.e., own loadings are higher than cross loadings), then convergent validity exists. Loadings, weights and the items used in this study are presented in Appendix A. In the examination of the conﬁrmatory factor analysis and the cross loadings of the items on other constructs, acceptable values were found for all item loadings on the intended

constructs (Gefen & Straub, 2005) (see Appendix B). Nearly all estimated standard loadings were signiﬁcant (P<0.001) (Gefen & Straub, 2005) and displayed an acceptable value (above 0.70) (Chin & Marcolin, 1995), which show a considerable convergent validity (see Appendix C). The values for all path coefﬁcients found in all the data (without from PS to DC) were reported above the minimum value of 0.1 (Sellin & Keeves, 1994; Huber et al, 2007) and the coefﬁcient of determination R2 is acceptable (Chin, 1998) (see Figure 2). The ﬁgure also shows the different values for men and women. In contrast, discriminate validity describes the divergence of one construct or test from another. By testing discriminate validity, the square root of the average variance extracted (AVE) should be larger than the absolute value of the interconstruct correlations (Gefen & Straub, 2005). Appendix A shows that in all the constructs, the square root of the AVE was found to be larger than all other cross-correlations.

Hypothesis testing structural equation modelling
The standardised PLS path coefﬁcients are shown in Figure 2. The results show that 50% of the variance in the intention to comply with data protection is explained by factors addressed in the integrated model (see Table 4). Without considering the factors of the GDT, the result values for the variance of data protection compliance intention changed to 47%. The factors that were left out had no further inﬂuence on the remaining factors in the entire model. In large part, the variance can be attributed to factors found in the TPB. As hypothesised, H1 is the positive effect of subjective norms is signiﬁcant in the compliance intention with regard to data protection legislation. In the full evaluation (β = 0.249, P<0.001), and those done separately according

to gender – men (β = 0.228, P<0.001) and women (β = 0.270, P<0.001) – the independent variable subjective norm (SN) was found to have a signiﬁcant effect on the intention to comply with data protection regulations (DI) whereas no relevant differences were found in the degree of inﬂuence between men and women. The inﬂuence of the independent variable perceived behaviour control (BC) for the intention to comply with the data protection regulations (DI) deﬁned in H2 was also found to be highly signiﬁcant (β = 0.209 P<0.001). In a separate evaluation, the value reported for men (β = 0.265, P<0.001) was 58% lower than that of women (β = 0.109, P<0.05). Therefore these values conﬁrmed H2. For H3, the analysis indicated that the attitudes towards security technology and data protection regulations positively affect data protection compliance intention. The values for the attitude (AT) have a highly signiﬁcant impact on the total results for data protection compliance intention (β = 0.319, P <0.001), which conﬁrm this hypothesis. The measured inﬂuence on men was lower by half (β = 0.230, P <0.05), while it increased among women (β = 0.433, P <0.001). The difference between men and women amounts to an increase of 88%. The effect found between the subjective norm (SN) and the variable attitude (AT) (β = 0.496, P <0.001) is signiﬁcant and, according to gender – men (β = 0.474, P<0.001) and women (β = 0.509, P<0.001) –no relevant differences were found in the degree of inﬂuence between men and women which thus conﬁrmed H4. The gender difference in the inﬂuence between the subjective norm (SN) and the perceived behavioural control (BC) is 32% higher for women (β = 0.300, P<0.001) than for men (β = 0.226, P<0.05) by a value reported in the full evaluation of β = 0.276 (P<0.001), which conﬁrmed H5.

The role of the GDT in this model (detection certainty and punishment severity) resulted in some ‘no signiﬁcant values’ found across the correspondents. The results of H6 conﬁrmed that the severity of discretionary punishment has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence or effect on the intention to comply with the data protection regulations (DI). The inﬂuence of the punishment severity (PS) reported in the full evaluation (β = 0.014, not signiﬁcant) and in the separate evaluations for men (β = 0.018, not signiﬁcant) and women (β = −0.001, not signiﬁcant) for the intention to comply with the data protection regulations (DI) does not make a notable difference. The probability of detection in breaches of data protection does not signiﬁcantly affect the adherence to data protection regulations in H7. The impact of independent variable detection certainty (DC) over the intention to comply with data protection regulations (DI) showed different values between men (β = 0.231, P<0.001) and women (β = 0.160, P<0.05). Signiﬁcant values for H8 showed that employee attitudes (AT) are positively inﬂuenced by the perceived behaviour control (BC). The values for the full evaluation is β = 0.435 (P<0.001) and has a difference of 32% in the signiﬁcant gender values for men (β = 0.411, P<0.001) and women (β = 0.545, P<0.01), which proved H8. Table 2 shows the path coefﬁcients in the complete results with the discrepancies between genders displayed in percentages. The signiﬁcance of the inﬂuence of gender on each variable was tested in the model (Gefen & Straub, 1997). The differences between men and women are signiﬁcant at P<0.001 for the variables BC, PS, DC and DI. At level P<0.01, the variables AT are signiﬁcant and at level P<0.05 the variables SN are signiﬁcant for the differences between men and women (Table 3).

Discussion of key findings and implications
The results can be used in awareness campaigns by using these factors to increase the intention to comply with data protection regulations. The results of this study support

the validity of the applied model as a theoretical framework for analysing the inﬂuencing factors on the intention to comply with data protection regulations. The results have identiﬁed the signiﬁcant factors with the greatest inﬂuence to the intention to comply with data protection regulations and also show that factors like punishment severity have no effect on the intention to comply with data protection regulations. This study extends the model of the TPB and the GDT by adding the gender variable to the model. The study shows several key ﬁndings and offers a few theoretical and practical conclusions. This is the ﬁrst research to use behaviour studies as a basis for examining the intention to comply with data protection regulations in conjunction with an analysis of gender inﬂuence in order to determine the reasons for behavioural acceptance of data protection regulations in hospitals. Similar models were applied together with information security in studies done outside of Europe (Dinev & Hu, 2007; Bulgurcu, 2008; Herath & Rao, 2009; Iﬁnedo, 2012), but without considering the impact of gender. The results show, however, that this model can also be applied in the assessment of the intention to comply with general data protection regulations in Germany and in analysis of the effect of gender thereupon. Study ﬁndings indicate that women and men differ in their intention to comply with data protection regulations and suggest that researchers should include gender in models for analysing the factors that inﬂuence behaviour and intention to follow data protection regulations. Moreover, managers and co-workers need to realise that their colleagues’ intentions to follow data protection regulations may differ according to their gender, thus suggesting

that additional measures might be created to account for these inﬂuences. The consequences of these results must be included in data protection awareness programs for employees and in addressing the value of data protection compliance for those in management, because managers are in a position to motivate employees to comply with the data protection regulations (Humaidi & Balakrishnan, 2013). The beneﬁt of these results is to understand the factors inﬂuencing the intention to comply and to apply this knowledge in practical ways, such as by:

protection regulations will have more inﬂuence on employees than will taking measures of punishment or detection certainty. 3. The signiﬁcance of gender differences can be used to deﬁne measures with gender-speciﬁc content and speech to inﬂuence the intention to comply with data protection regulations. The results indicate a clear, gender-speciﬁc difference regarding perception, behaviour and attitude in achieving the intention to comply with data protection regulations. Future evaluations should examine the inﬂuence of additional factors such as age, period of occupation and the type of facility. The results provide implications for further research in male or female dominated organisations, where it is important to identify gender-speciﬁc differences in the factors that inﬂuence the intention to comply with data protection regulations. This will facilitate the planning and creation of measures for using the gender-speciﬁc factors that have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on intention and avoid using measures like sanctions, which are often used instead (Pahnila et al, 2007). As a result, awareness programs for data protection should focus on the signiﬁcant factors and the differences in the intention of the genders to effectivelyw protect data in health-care organisations (Table 4). Overall, the results show that there are indicators with a signiﬁcant bearing on behaviours and attitudes towards the intention to comply with data protection regulations and that if some behaviour favourably impacts the hospital, or could be useful for the hospital, it is probable that the employees are adhering to regulations. Therefore, it is important and necessary that the management conveys their understanding of the correlation between personal behaviour and the value for the hospital to their employees, along with an awareness of the gender speciﬁc differences. Above all, those working in hospitals must be made aware of the potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, threats and the consequences for individual employees with regard to data protection and management. The availability of resources (training, information, sensitisation) proved to be important to both male and female personnel, which could be used to facilitate a higher level of acceptance of data protection regulations among them. In doing so, the accessibility of competent contact persons and the availability of the relevant rules and regulations pertaining to data protection are relevant factors. Also, the results show that social inﬂuence plays an important role in the acceptance of data protection regulations. Management, supervisors and data protection ofﬁcers have the greatest inﬂuence on the formation of personal attitudes among employees in gaining the acceptance of data protection regulations. Similar results were found in the intention to comply with security policies in organisations (Herath & Rao, 2009; Al-Omari et al, 2013; Humaidi & Balakrishnan, 2013; Goo et al, 2013). However, the direct inﬂuence of colleagues does not carry the same level of inﬂuence. This shows that the desire for compliance with data protection regulations

●

motivating superiors who exemplify the observance of the data protection regulations; creating measures to inﬂuence the attitude towards data protection compliance with gender-speciﬁc approaches, because the effect here is greater for women; installing a targeted awareness programme for perceived behaviour control, aimed at the awareness of men, as this factor has a stronger effect on men.

Previous measures to ensure compliance with data protection rules in German hospitals were made by teaching the legal principles to be followed. The ﬁrst result from the ﬁndings of this study in awareness campaigns shows that through reﬂecting on the factors with high signiﬁcance, an increase in the acceptance to comply with data protection regulations can be achieved. The demonstration of personal beneﬁt and the individual recognition of the advantages have led to a higher acceptance rate of complying with the regulations. In addition, the results of this study show that measures with gender-speciﬁc content (mailings, posters, web-based programmes) lead to a higher rate of acceptance in complying with the regulations. The TPB and factors of the GDT are used in this study to assess the behaviour and attitudes exhibited by employees in a hospital on a theoretical level in order to determine their observance of data protection regulations and guidelines. The highly sensitive data accessible in hospitals must be used correctly, by all groups of workers in the hospital, in accordance with the data protection regulations. A number of strategies can be adopted during training to strengthen the attitudes of employees towards the transfer of this new knowledge. From a practical perspective, this research offers the following implications for the adherence to data protection guidelines and regulations in hospitals: 1. To raise the awareness of the employees in their acceptance of the regulations in their daily work, and taking measures with gender-speciﬁc technical and organisational parameters must be designed to inﬂuence the intention to comply. 2. Positive promotion of data protection compliance by the management is encouraged, because the subjective norms have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence which suggests that measures must be deﬁned that explain the interdependence between these values and how they apply to hospital employees’ adherence to the regulations. Taking measures to encourage the acceptance of data

The subjective norm (SN) shows high significance for the intention to comply without differences in gender The perceived behavioural control (BC) for the data protection compliance intention shows significant differences among women and men and should be used to influence daily work for all groups in hospital The attitude (AT) is relevant in the gender difference and should be used, for example, by means of raised awareness to influence men and women to comply with data protection regulations The results of the high significance of the influence of the attitude (AT) and subjective norms (SN) without relevance in the gender differences should be considered in the design of organisational measures and the management of data protection in hospital The effect between the subjective norm (SN) and the perceived behaviour control (BC) is highly significant and also shows differences between genders. These results should be used to define measures in awareness in order to influence the intention to comply with data protection regulations The punishment severity (PS) shows no significance in the overall results, only among women in the gender-based results. So, the use of punishment severity should be reconsidered in methods to improve data protection compliance. Straub & Welke (1998) and Williams & Hawkins (1986) found the punishment severity a significant influence in models for information security. In the model for the intention to comply with data protection regulations the results of punishment severity are not significant, so further studies are needed to determine the reasons for the low influence of PS The measures of detection certainty (DC) also show differences in the gender-specific results with high significance in the general results and the gender values, so these measures are relevant for influencing the intention to comply with data protection regulations. Also Straub & Welke (1998) and Williams & Hawkins (1986) found the detection certainty a significant influence in the models for information security and also Vroom & von Solms (2004) argued that this form of evaluation is required to investigate security compliance The significant difference concerning gender in the influence between attitude (AT) and the perceived behaviour control (BC) should be used to raise awareness under the use of these results

taken in conjunction with opinions shows a signiﬁcant inﬂuence as a model in the hierarchy structure and can be used to facilitate the acceptance of, and natural consideration for, regulations in the course of daily work. Deterrence, like the threat of punishment, also inﬂuences the observance of data protection regulations. These measures do not necessarily promote data protection compliance. The probability that data protection rules will be recognised inﬂuences the violations in data protection compliance behaviour but is not especially distinct when measured in connection with the potential for punishment. Nevertheless, this notion must be considered here in with regard to sensitisation. Sanctions have been met with various appraisals (Kankanhalli et al, 2003; Pahnila et al, 2007). However, more potent than the severity of penalties for noncompliance are the implementation and acknowledgement of detection mechanisms. Additional factors that inﬂuence data protection compliance, most of all the gender-speciﬁc differences, must be more closely examined in the future. Future investigations, interviews and perhaps group discussions could provide additional information regarding which aspects are essential for inﬂuencing hospital staff to observe data protection rules and guidelines in their daily work without being expressly told to do so. Reward measures for achieving data protection compliance and the observance of regulations and guidelines were not considered in this study because incentives should not be employed to achieve compliance with legal requirements. Furthermore, no other personality characteristics of the individuals surveyed were considered

among the possibly inﬂuential factors in this study. Recent literature in security topics has included information on personality factors such as responsibility acceptance, conscientiousness and agreeableness (Shropshire et al, 2006), which require further description to understand their effect on threat perceptions, protection motivations and policy compliance. Despite the considerable variation among the legal regulations of data protection, this study could be highly applicable outside of the European Union and useful in achieving an internationally recognised standard for comparison in hospitals and health care. This would allow us to make a statement on the inﬂuence of government regulation and the scope of state administration on acceptance. This would also be an interesting extension within other sectors (i.e., banking and industry) for determining industry-speciﬁc inﬂuences on data protection compliance. This study has opened up promising new methods for the research on intention to comply with data protection regulations. The results of this study suggest that a new approach, consisting of the combination of two frameworks, may produce better results than each framework alone. To better understand the various factors which inﬂuence the intention to comply with data protection regulations of employees, both the GDT and TPB frameworks can be applied to on-going research. A second positive outcome of this study is the conﬁrmation of the effectiveness of the TPB and GDT frameworks when measuring the positive inﬂuence of factors – such as social norms, attitude towards data protection

compliance and perceived vulnerability – on employee data protection compliance. An additional research approach referenced in this study is the option to integrate theoretical perspectives from external research areas, as used by Herath & Rao (2009), in an attempt to expand the general knowledge in this area. Data protection compliance is determined by social imperatives, individual attitudes and the assessments of threat and coping strategies as seen in our ﬁndings. In their study, D’Arcy & Hovav (2004) found that the punishment severity (PS) and the detection certainty (DC) of the GDT model show a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on compliance with information security regulations. Also Straub & Welke (1998) and Williams & Hawkins (1986) found the DC and PS to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the models for information security, while Vroom & von Solms (2004) argued that the form of DC evaluation is required to investigate the security compliance. In the model for the intention to comply with data protection regulations, the results differ in their signiﬁcance. Further studies are needed to determine the reasons for the low inﬂuence of PS. Perhaps there are serious reasons accounting for the different perceptions of data protection and information security, even though only data protection is regulated by laws while information security is not. Literature in this ﬁeld also supports the claims that selfefﬁcacy and response efﬁcacy, as well as social norms, attitudes towards compliance and perceived vulnerability affect employees’ compliance in data protection. This research provides a next-step approach to the further development of a model that would be both integrative and comprehensive and designed to assess data protection compliance in a variety of organisations.

Limitations and conclusion
The lack of compliance with data protection regulations in all organisations is a widespread issue that is inﬂuenced by many factors, including employee psychology. The ﬁndings of this paper show the usefulness of analysing the intention to comply with data protection regulations in hospitals. University hospitals are not part of the data because none of the respondents work in a university hospital. The intention to comply in university hospitals may be different because so many doctors rely on patient data for research. Therefore it could be that the intention to comply with data protection regulations is different for this group than in the other hospitals. This is one of the earliest studies to analyse these factors in the intention to comply with data protection regulations and it shows the signiﬁcance of gender. Further research must differentiate the effects in hospitals among the various occupational groups because some groups differ greatly in their representation of men and women, for example, a higher percentage of doctors are male, whereas a higher percentage of nurses are female. This research shows the use of a robust framework for analysing the intention to comply with data protection

regulations. This model is very general and can be applied to any organisation or facility interested in data protection compliance and would show comparable values between different industries. The protection of data and, therefore, the intention to comply are based on national regulations for data protection. Germany has some of the strictest regulations for the protection of data in the world. These regulations are based on the European Data Protection Directive which sets a minimum standard for all European countries to abide by. Therefore, based on the same standard, the results can be used for analysing the intention to comply with data protection regulations across Europe. The European Commission has prepared a new data protection directive. In the future (there is already a directive, but that a new European Data Protection Regulation is now in place), these new regulations will be the same for all European countries and will provide, together with this study, a standard for the comparison of levels of intentional data protection. This result indicates that intentional compliance is dependent on a combination of organisational, personal factors and gender-speciﬁc factors. The result of uniform legal rules on data protection in Europe in the future (in the current state of the discussion for the new data protection rules of the European Union at the beginning of 2016 expects a decision) and the results of this study provide an opportunity for all European countries to embrace compliance and can be also applied to industries other than health care. Although there are laws and requirements that are obligatory for data protection, they are insufﬁcient for the observance of data protection compliance and require additional measures for facilitating acceptance of data protection compliance. Technology, the threat of punishment, or the behaviour demonstrated by superiors are – when considered alone – insufﬁcient and do not ensure data protection compliance by employees. In fact, data protection compliance among hospital personnel is the result of concurrent inﬂuences that result from individual attitudes that are strongly characterised by user-friendliness and individual perceptions. Above all, the probability of violation and the associated consequences for the hospital present an essential factor encouraging the creation of a culture of acceptance that favours data protection compliance. Technical conditions and the inﬂuence of superiors are also notable factors that imply subjective observation and facilitate data protection compliance in an employee’s behaviour on an individual level. The gender-speciﬁc differences found in this study show that there must be new approaches in working towards raising awareness and education among hospital employees regarding data protection compliance in their daily work. In this study, a model was formed which provided meaningful results for measuring the data protection compliance of the TPB and the GDT. Additionally, gender differences were used in the analysis of this model. In conclusion, the present work provides hospital managers with the factors that inﬂuence data protection

compliance among their employees. These results must be taken into consideration in order to facilitate awareness of improving data protection compliance. It also suggests ways that researchers can explore the domain of data protection compliance based on this applied model. The two theoretical models were largely supported by the results and identify several strong predictors of data protection compliance that were previously unexamined in the ﬁeld of information systems. This study examined the problem of noncompliance with data protection

regulations because although employee data protection compliance is a major concern for organisations, little research has been done to uncover the root of the problem. To address this gap in the research, this study examined and analysed the inﬂuencing factors on the intention to comply with data protection regulations. Therefore the results of this study substantially contribution to our understanding of the issue of deliberate data protection compliance and provide valuable insights for data protection practitioners to use in their reinforcement of data protection compliance in organisations going forward.
