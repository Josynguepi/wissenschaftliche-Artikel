Abstract This paper focuses on the process of maximizing the benefits from a business intelligence (BI) application. A general theoretical framework of analysis is formulated based on previous research into organizational deep structure and inertia. Our framework is applied to a case study of a U.K. retail bank which used an existing customer profitability BI application to transform its marketing strategy. We find that an organization’s ability to extract strategic BI benefits is influenced by its deep structure (core beliefs, organizational structures, control systems and distribution of power) and also by its ability to overcome the effects of the multiple inertia sources that the deep structure generates. Organizations should therefore carefully consider the effects of multidimensional organizational inertia and aim to manage inertia sources in respect to information from BI applications when links that embed the BI into an organization as a whole are developed and maintained. We also present generally applicable insights into enhancing the delivery of informative long-term BI decision support for organizations.

Introduction
The role of business intelligence (BI) applications has become of strategic importance for many businesses as executives use these technologies to address business priorities (Negash, 2004; Gartner Research, 2012). The BI support includes the meaningful integration and aggregation of vast amounts of organizational (and in some cases external) data originating from various sources and the multidimensional analysis of these data (Olszak & Ziemba, 2007). The BI output represents timely and actionable information which informs managerial decisions (Negash, 2004). The BI usually include or are linked to specialized data bases (e.g., data warehouses) and use specialized IT infrastructure such as data query, analytical and reporting tools (Elbashir et al, 2008). Key organizational beneﬁts of BI, which are the main focus of this study, include better management decisions at both middle management and strategic levels and support for the accomplishment of strategic business objectives; a comprehensive list of BI beneﬁts is given in Watson (2009).

Despite the growing importance of BI for the business community and on-going business investments into BI (Gartner Research, 2012), many banks and other organizations fail to exploit BI to its full capabilities (e.g., Ćurko et al, 2007; Hallikainen et al, 2012). This issue highlights a limited understanding of factors that determine long-term BI beneﬁts with such factors having received scarce attention in the BI literature (Jourdan et al, 2008). It is important to speciﬁcally consider the long-term BI exploitation as the strategic decision making that BI supports is longterm in nature and its beneﬁts may not be fully realized over a short-term post-implementation period. More importantly, BI beneﬁts in the short run are assessed under current business conditions that are unlikely to have changed greatly since the BI implementation. In contrast, the long-term BI beneﬁts are inﬂuenced by uncertainty and a changing business environment. The BI beneﬁts therefore are likely to be determined by the organization and BI’s joint ability to adapt to an evolving environment, which in turn critically depends on the organization’s ability to overcome inertia (e.g., Romanelli & Tushman, 1994; Rumelt, 1995). The conditional nature of the BI beneﬁts is further pointed out by Lönnqvist & Pirttimäki (2006). These beneﬁts can only be realized when the BI generated information is integrated into management decisions and the outcome of this process is conditional not only on the technical aspects but also on an appropriate integration of the BI into an organization as a whole. The inter-dependence of BI beneﬁts and broader organizational factors has not been well understood (e.g., Alter, 2004). The very limited understanding of (a) the links between the organization as a whole and the BI beneﬁts and (b) the organizational factors that support the sustainable delivery of BI beneﬁts motivates the need for theorizing in these areas that will improve our understanding and motivate further research. Our study makes an initial step toward addressing this gap. We adopt the constructs of the organization’s deep structure and organizational inertia from the organizational change literature (Tushman & Romanelli, 1985; Gersick, 1991; Besson & Rowe, 2012) to formulate a theoretical framework that emphasizes organizational factors that support the organization’s ability to maximize BI beneﬁts during the long-term BI use. Our study integrates the literature from the organizational change, alignment and BI success areas and offers some new insights into the effects of organizational inertia and also factors that enable an appropriate alignment for extracting strategic BI beneﬁts. The relevant theoretical concepts are introduced in our theoretical framework section. We ﬁnd that the organization’s deep structure (core beliefs, organizational structures, control systems and distribution of power) and also the processes that embed the BI into an organization as a whole are both important for the organization’s ability to extract the expected BI beneﬁts during the long-term BI exploitation. Even if the BI is successfully implemented, multidimensional

organizational inertia that the deep structure generates, if not appropriately managed, may prevent the BI from delivering its expected beneﬁts in the long run. Hence, in addition to recognizing the important role of the deep structure, organizations should carefully consider the effects of multidimensional organizational inertia and aim to manage inertia sources in respect to information from the BI when links between the BI and the deep structure are developed and maintained. We apply our framework to a case study involving the post-implementation use of a BI at National Australia Group Europe (NAGE), trading in the United Kingdom as Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank (CYB). Our case study results conﬁrm that it is the interaction of the organization’s deep structure with the BI (and not the BI factors or technical factors alone) that determines long-term BI success. We ﬁnd that even when the BI is aligned with the organization at implementation and receives senior management support (e.g., Finlay & Forghani, 1998; Poon & Wagner, 2001; Sabherwal et al, 2001), various dimensions of organizational inertia can prevent a robust BI application from meeting key management expectations. On the basis of our analysis we offer a number of practically applicable insights that are generalizable to other BI applications and other organizations. Our paper is set out as follows. The next section outlines the relevant academic literature and introduces our formal theoretical framework of analysis and our detailed research questions. Our research methodology is introduced next, followed by discussion of the customer proﬁtability BI application and formulation of the problem. The analysis section which includes the discussion of insights from our case study and their generalization follows. Finally, our conclusions are offered.

Theoretical framework
This section ﬁrst summarizes the previous studies of BI success factors. Our framework for analyzing the interdependencies between the BI and its organizational context is detailed next. We draw on our framework to analyze the interrelations between the deep structure and the BI and also the effects of organizational inertia. Finally we formulate our research questions.

BI success literature Despite the growing importance of BI, academic studies of factors that determine the long-term success or failure of BI applications are limited. Existing BI studies focus mainly on implementation success (e.g., Arnott, 2008; Yeoh & Koronios, 2010), the measurement of BI beneﬁts (e.g., Gibson et al, 2004; Lönnqvist & Pirttimäki, 2006; Elbashir et al, 2008) and also factors that determine the realized monetary BI value (Williams & Williams, 2003; Williams & Williams, 2004). Studies of monetary BI value, however, may not be able to capture many key organizational beneﬁts such as support for the accomplishment of strategic business objectives and also better management

decision making (Lönnqvist & Pirttimäki, 2006; Watson, 2009; Schieder & Gluchowski, 2011). Given the limited literature on long-term BI success we also draw on studies of personal decision support systems, executive information systems and, to some extent, data warehousing, which are all considered to be predecessors of modern BI in that their main purpose is to assist in managerial decision making. These studies mainly focus on the success factors for the development and implementation stages of such applications whereas factors that directly address long-term success have not received adequate attention. A successful IS implementation and also user involvement contribute to the perceived post-implementation success in the Wixom & Watson (2001) data warehousing success model. Even though the importance of (senior) management support and highly-skilled users is widely acknowledged mainly for the BI implementation stage (e.g., Sanders & Courtney, 1985; Poon & Wagner, 2001), the broad-based management support and the lasting commitment of resources both remain of key importance during the postimplementation phase as ‘the greatest beneﬁts … usually occur later rather than immediately’ (Wixom & Watson, 2001, p. 36). Furthermore, the expected long-term BI beneﬁts can only be achieved if the top and middle management remain committed to its use and deploy the BI-generated information strategically. The alignment of the decision support type application development with the business objectives (e.g., Finlay & Forghani, 1998; Weir et al, 2003) and the adaptive, evolutionary development of the BI toward the effective application set (e.g., Poon & Wagner, 2001; Salmeron & Herrero, 2005; Arnott, 2008) have also been found to be essential; both factors remain highly relevant during the long-term BI exploitation. First, it takes a prolonged period of time for some organizations to achieve an appropriate alignment in what should be viewed as a dynamic process (Sabherwal et al, 2001). A key underlying reason in the BI case is that the organization’s understanding of information interdependencies and also the organizational learning (of BI capabilities and how these could be fully exploited) develop over time and are accompanied by process adjustments (Abraham & Junglas, 2011; Hallikainen et al, 2012). Second, the changing business environment and business needs will require an on-going re-alignment between the BI and the organization as a whole to enable the delivery of decision-making beneﬁts. This re-alignment process will require the BI application to remain adaptive. An organization will also need to possess an adequate set of skills to implement the BI adjustments and to exploit the evolved BI application. In a similar way to the implementation process, the BI adjustment is likely to beneﬁt from appropriate user involvement. Furthermore, the application adaptability and also decision-making beneﬁts are among the factors that ensure the organizational commitment to the decision support type applications (Finlay & Forghani, 1998). Schieder & Gluchowski (2011) also emphasize the importance of organizational maturity which primarily

deals with the development level of organizational structures and processes in the BI context that enables the BI integration into a wider organizational context and also contributes to organization’s capability to strategically apply the BI to address its business priorities (Wixom & Watson, 2010). Organizational maturity therefore will also inﬂuence the on-going BI (re-) alignment with the organization as a whole during the long-term post-implementation use.

Deep structure and organizational inertia Focusing on the BI success factors alone might be necessary but not sufﬁcient to ensure that the organization obtains the expected beneﬁts from a BI application in the long run; a broader contextual set of factors and its interaction with the BI also should be taken into account. Organization’s deep structure For our theoretical development we adopt a concept of deep structure from a punctuated equilibrium model of organizational change (e.g., Tushman & Romanelli, 1985; Gersick, 1991). This particular representation of the organizational structure (which is a common concept across alternative models of organizational evolution, see, e.g., Hannan & Freeman, 1984, for the case of Darwinian models of organizational change) is best suited for the purposes of our study as it enables considering an organization as a ‘sociopolitical arena’ (Silva & Hirschheim, 2007, p. 332). This concept therefore potentially provides a very useful construct for studying the links between the innovative IS developments and the organization’s social dynamics (Sabherwal et al, 2001; Silva & Hirschheim, 2007). Building on the work of Gersick (1991), Romanelli & Tushman (1994, p. 1144) describe the organization’s deep structure as ‘a system of interrelated organizational parts that is maintained by mutual dependencies among the parts’ through regular organizational activity patterns. This concept consists of ﬁve facets: (a) core beliefs and values regarding the organization, its employees and its environment, (b) products, markets, technology and competitive timing, (c) the distribution of power, (d) the organization’s structure and (e) the organization’s control systems (Tushman & Romanelli, 1985, p. 176). Organizational inertia As the facets of the deep structure originate from a set of fundamental choices made by an organization, together they form a highly stable structure. This stability is reinforced by the mutually dependent choices that the system supports and also by the ability of this system to reinforce itself as a whole through multiple shared feedback mechanisms (Gersick, 1991). The consequential organizational inertia, which arises as a natural derivative from routinizing organizational processes that become rigid once the organization becomes established (Besson & Rowe, 2012), does not permit any alternatives to be generated outside of the existing deep structure and the related processes (Gersick, 1991). The organizational transformation literature regards organizational inertia as a complex process that consists

of ﬁve interrelated inertia dimensions: psychological, sociocognitive, socio-technical, economic and political (e.g., Tushman et al, 1986; Hannan et al, 2002; Besson & Rowe, 2012). While the ﬁrst dimension tends to be an individual attribute, the latter four relate to inertia, or ‘stickiness’, at the group and organizational levels; Besson & Rowe (2012) give comprehensive summaries of these dimensions. The importance of inertia is concisely encapsulated in a quote by Moore (2004, p. 91): ‘For most executive teams, battling the inertia demon is the biggest challenge they face. Sad to say, the demon usually wins’.

enables a systematic investigation of the effects of the deep structure and its inherent organizational inertia on the organization’s ability to extract the expected BI beneﬁts. It also facilitates the examination of the joint impact of all interrelated inertia dimensions, as recommended by Besson & Rowe (2012) and evidenced in Abraham & Junglas (2011), Berg (2001) and Sarker & Lee (1999). Also, in contrast to the previous literature which mainly focuses on IT (IS) implementation projects, this study highlights the importance of understanding and managing the effects of multidimensional inertia during the long-term use of BI.

Theoretical framework of analysis We draw on the extant research described above to develop an appropriate theoretical framework of analysis. We present our theoretical framework by building on the Silva & Hirschheim (2007) metaphorical representation of the deep structure as a classical house. We incorporate a multidimensional inertia construct into this representation in a form of a soft medium that supports the facets of the deep structure and enforces the stability of the entire structure (Figure 1). As in Silva & Hirschheim (2007), core beliefs and values form a foundation for the formal organizational structure and distribution of power which both in turn support the control systems. These four facets form a basis for products, markets, technology and competitive timing. This framework extends the organizational transformation literature by explicitly incorporating inertia into our deep structure representation and emphasizing interconnections between the organization’s deep structure and multidimensional inertia. As a result, the proposed framework

Organizational deep structure, inertia and BI success This section draws on our theoretical framework of analysis to investigate the links between the deep structure and the BI success factors and the effects of various dimensions of organizational inertia. We focus on the core beliefs and values, distribution of power, organizational structure, and control systems facets of the deep structure. The ﬁfth facet, products, markets, technology and competitive timing, builds on the ﬁrst four facets (Figure 1) so that changes in this facet need to be supported by modiﬁcations in the remaining four facets (Silva & Hirschheim, 2007). Core beliefs and values The entrepreneurial attitudes toward technology of the top management, employees’ general attitudes toward technology and the organization’s capability to learn from competitors, which are all linked to a set of core beliefs and values of an organization, determine the organization’s capability to apply BI strategically (Benjamin et al, 1984; Mata et al, 1995). A very extensive organizational transformation literature also underlines the central role of the organizational culture and ensuing socio-cognitive inertia (Besson & Rowe, 2012), which is formed around the core beliefs and values of an organization (e.g., Peters & Waterman, 1982; Philip & Mckeown, 2004). Moreover, a fundamental change in the organizational culture is often a pre-requisite of a successful organizational transformation (Philip & Mckeown, 2004). In addition, socio-cognitive and other sources of organizational inertia such as negative psychology, political inertia and socio-technical inertia that are all linked to the organization’s core beliefs and values can jointly impair the delivery of expected BI beneﬁts. For example, in the Hallikainen et al (2012) case study of BI use within a retail organization, overcoming all of these interrelated inertia sources underlined the change in the organizational mindset from ‘silo thinking to optimizing the whole throughout the organization’. This change enabled BI to deliver its full strategic decision-making beneﬁts after almost 10 years had elapsed from its initial implementation. The case studies of Abraham & Junglas (2011) and Mangan & Kelly (2009) further establish that IS driven business development projects can be considerably delayed, incur large over-spending and eventually brought to a halt if the key stakeholders have inconsistencies and

clashes in cultural norms and ideology; these sources of inertia are often hidden behind the technical issues and can be dangerously overlooked.

Distribution of power The extent of the top and middle management support and their level of commitment both can be affected by their vested interests and political agenda. Hidden political agenda of the top management can have a particularly destructive effect on the BI-driven organizational development during the post-implementation phase due to the high time, ﬁnancial and emotional costs of un-coordinated and ill-supported development efforts. The vested values and interests of informal as opposed to formal leadership networks (e.g., Rumelt, 1995), can also cause deadlocks as these networks can inﬂuence both the top management decisions and the implementation of these decisions in practice. Some users, for example, may have a political agenda embedded in the new development: for example, access to another department’s information resources or detailed knowledge of their working patterns which may lead to conﬂicts and threaten the application use (e.g., Bowers, 1995; Berg, 2001). As the BI has the ability to introduce radical changes to the organizational alignment, and hence to the distribution of both resources and power, BI-driven business development projects may be perceived as a threat and met with resistance by some managers. Even if the BI project receives wide-spread support at the implementation stage, open or hidden opponents may emerge as sources of political inertia at a later stage if speciﬁc BI-driven strategic developments threaten their position of power. Political inertia rooted in vested values and interests may lead to economic inertia as it often causes costly political deadlocks associated with wasted time, human and ﬁnancial resources (Rumelt, 1995; Sarker & Lee, 1999). These deadlocks may also cause insufﬁcient resource allocation to either the BI exploitation or to the BI-driven developments if these developments meet opposition among some senior managers. Organizational structures An adequate level of development in the organizational structures and processes, or organizational maturity, is a pre-requisite for the integration of BI outputs into management decision making and also for enabling an organization to use the BI strategically to address its business priorities (Wixom & Watson, 2010; Schieder & Gluchowski, 2011). Also, failure to adjust outdated organizational structures to deﬁne the role of key highly skilled staff or to make provisions for their competitive compensation packages affects the ability to hire and retain highly skilled staff; this is evidenced in, for example, Silva & Hirschheim (2007). Furthermore, the alignment with the organization requires an appropriate alignment not only between the business and IS objectives but also between the business and IS structures and processes (Cooper et al, 2000; Sabherwal et al, 2001). This alignment is dynamic because

strategic IS-driven developments introduce the need for radical changes in the organizational structure, for example, by removing informational barriers between different divisions and encouraging a change in the focus of the structural conﬁguration from the division of labor to the division of knowledge (Lucas & Baroudi, 1994; Teo et al, 1997; Berg, 2001). Such developments also introduce a process of mutual transformation of both the organization and technology. This transformation cannot be planned or pre-speciﬁed and should be carefully managed, building on the existing techno-social ﬁt (Berg, 2001). Cross-fertilization inputs from different stakeholders during the IT use add an impetus to continuous organizational learning and related adjustments in both the IT and business processes (Abraham & Junglas, 2011). Also, BI evolves in response to on-going improvements in business processes (e.g., the introduction of performance measures for business strategy) and changes in business needs (Watson, 2009). A failure to understand and appropriately manage the alignment between the organizational and IT structures and processes is often rooted in strong socio-technical inertia that along with other interrelated sources of organizational inertia impair both IT development and IT-driven organizational change (e.g., Berg, 2001; Hallikainen et al, 2012). The literature on IT-enabled organizational transformation (Besson & Rowe, 2012) provides many examples of transformation failures that are linked to socio-technical inertia and other related inertia sources. Control systems are key to the management of an ongoing BI adjustment to evolving business strategy and business needs and also BI-driven business development projects as the project management skills are required to manage frictions and tensions between different stakeholders (Charalambos, 1999; Silva & Hirschheim, 2007). This is important as conﬂicting views of the key stakeholders due to their political agendas or genuine differing beliefs about the nature of the problem or its possible solutions, if not appropriately managed, may lead to costly political deadlocks (e.g., Rumelt, 1995; Mangan & Kelly, 2009). Furthermore, it is essential for an organization to be able to meaningfully interpret, analyze and integrate the BI information into decision making; this is supported by control systems that allow the organization to hire, retain and train highly skilled staff (e.g., Sanders & Courtney, 1985; Wixom & Watson, 2001). The organization’s IT skills are also important for supporting the evolution of the BI over time and its recurrent alignment with changing business processes and business needs, whereas the organization’s inability to procure these skills impairs both IT functionality and usability (e.g., Sarker & Lee, 1999). Organizational knowledge and capability to apply IT strategically are required to address the organization’s business priorities using the BI (Wixom & Watson, 2010; Schieder & Gluchowski, 2011). Adequate user involvement in the BI adjustment during its long-term exploitation is likely to contribute to its future usability and also its match with organizational processes. Furthermore, the BI-enabled

organizational change, in turn, may introduce changes to the organizational control processes and coordination.

Research questions This section concludes our theoretical analysis and leads to the development of our research questions that focus on the interrelation between the BI and the deep structure. The inﬂuence of the deep structure The strategic role of BI applications in improving management decision making and enabling an organization to address its business priorities implies close interrelations between the BI and the organization’s deep structure. The decision support type applications that enable either strategic or operational decision making affect the deep structure as they often bring about changes in the work tasks and processes, the re-distribution of the resource allocation and introduce higher task interdependence between different organizational functions (e.g., Sharma & Yetton, 2003; Silva & Hirschheim, 2007). The BI, in turn, evolves over time (a) to achieve an appropriate alignment with the organization as a whole, including its speciﬁc business objectives, structures and processes (Moreton, 1995; Sabherwal et al, 2001) and (b) to adjust in response to changing business model and business needs. The success of such BI evolution will also be affected by the characteristics of the deep structure. Given that many strategic decision-making beneﬁts from the BI can only be realized over a long-term horizon, the impact of the deep structure remains important during the long-term BI exploitation. Our analysis illustrates that relevant long-term BI success factors are directly inﬂuenced by the deep structure: core beliefs and values, structures, distribution of power and control systems which motivates our ﬁrst research question.
Research question 1: How does an organization’s deep structure (its core beliefs and values, structures, distribution of power and control structures) inﬂuence the BI ability to deliver its expected long-term beneﬁts?

widely recognized as an important short-term success factor, in particular, leads to complacency and inertia over a longer term exploitation horizon as it narrows the organizational outlook and hampers the ability to detect and act on new opportunities (Sabherwal et al, 2001). This is because such alignment restricts the information discovery capability of the BI and importantly, its ability to capture information that does not conform to the current business model or falls outside of the established reporting structures. New developments in the environment and related changes in the internal data therefore can be easily overlooked, leading to inferior BI decision support. Also, even if signals of internal or external misalignment are detected by the BI, a high degree of inertia in the deep structure may prevent such signals from being heard or acted upon and lead to adverse consequences that may even threaten the survival of the organization (Greenwood & Hinings, 1996). Numerous examples of organizational failures to transform which are linked to a joint impact of multiple inertia sources are listed in Besson & Rowe (2012). It is therefore essential to carefully consider the effects of multidimensional organizational inertia when the links between the BI and the deep structure are developed. Research question 2: How and in what way do the multiple sources of organizational inertia that the deep structure generates affect the delivery of expected long-term BI beneﬁts?

Methodology
Our theoretical framework is applied to the CYB case study to enable a systematic interpretation. CYB was chosen as it motivated our research and also provided access to rich data about both its proﬁtability BI and its organizational environment that would not be accessible otherwise. This allowed the research questions to be comprehensively studied within the natural complex environment of a business organization where many signiﬁcant factors and links can be observed and fully accounted for (Avison, 1993, p. 496). We adopt a broadly interpretivist approach aiming to understand the context of the BI application and the processes by which this application inﬂuences and is inﬂuenced by that context (Walsham, 1993; Klein & Myers, 1999). In particular, we follow the principles of the hermeneutic circle, contextualization and interaction between the researchers and the subjects which were put forward by Klein & Myers (1999). We take a hermeneutic outlook by iterating between the various facets of the organizational deep structure, related inertia dimensions and the relevant aspects of the BI application, and the overall organizational ability to extract expected BI beneﬁts which they combine to inﬂuence. The contextualization of the research setting is important for understanding the emergence of the situation leading to the failure of the BI application to deliver the expected beneﬁts in a strategically important area. We also take care to reﬂect on the effects of the interaction between the researchers and

The effects of organizational inertia As an increasing number of organizations operate in moderate to fast changing environments (due to frequent marketplace changes, shorter product cycle lives, more highly tailored products and services, changing social values and demographic patterns and evolving methods of business management), it is important for such organizations to develop an in-built capability to detect and respond to changing business environment (Moreton, 1995). The vast organizational transformation literature evidences that organizational inertia represents a key challenge in this process. Such BI-based capability faces the issue of overcoming organizational inertia that stems from the established organizational deep structure and it is enforced by the routine processes that embed the BI into the organization. Close organizational alignment with the BI, which is

organizational actors on our research as our ﬁndings are necessarily affected by the jointly formed interpretations of the parties involved. Our overall methodological approach, as a result, allows us to capture the interaction between innovative technological developments such as BI and the organizational context (Franz & Robey, 1984; Walsham, 1995; Darke et al, 1998).

warehousing provisions which were implemented as part of the merger of the two NAGE-owned U.K. banks’ operations.

Background to the case study CYB background Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank are well-established regional retail banks which were founded in the 19th century in Glasgow, Scotland, and Halifax in the English county of Yorkshire, respectively. Both banks joined the National Australia Bank Group: Clydesdale Bank in 1987 and Yorkshire Bank in 1990. Since 2001, the two U.K.-based banks’ head quarters and operations have been merged and the Yorkshire Bank has become a part of the Clydesdale Bank, although it has continued trading under its own name. Operations of the merged bank include personal banking, private banking and business banking. At September 2011, CYB had £44.9 billion in total assets, £23.3 billion in retail deposits and £33.0 billion in gross loans and acceptances, ﬁgures which are characteristic of a medium-size regional bank (National Australia Bank Group, 2011). In the same ﬁnancial year, the bank reported an increase in underlying annual proﬁts of 4% to £533 million which was viewed as a healthy result under the prevailing weak economic conditions. Customer base business strategy From the early years of the new millennium, one of the strategic business objectives of CYB was to maximize the value of its customer base. As the ﬁrst stage of the strategy implementation, CYB initiated a successful customer base expansion campaign which attracted a large number of private (wealthy) customers. As the next stage, the CYB management were looking for new promising customer groups within their retail sector who were already highly proﬁtable to the CYB or had a high propensity of becoming highly proﬁtable in the future to serve as a strategic target for customer management and acquisition. This was expected to enhance the CYB customer base by retaining and acquiring customers with high customer value. To assist in achieving this business objective, in 2005 CYB launched a new customer proﬁtability BI application which was expected to provide intelligence allowing the differentiation of CYB retail customers by their proﬁtability to the bank, the identiﬁcation of valuable customer groups and the provision of customer management leads. In this development, CYB adopted an approach similar to that of First American Corporation (FAC) and other companies that have moved from a traditional banking model to a customer relationship-oriented approach (Cooper et al, 2000). In contrast to the Cooper et al (2000) study of FAC’s organizational transformation, which was enabled by a new data warehouse, CYB developed its customer proﬁtability BI using existing data

The motivation behind the case study Despite the widely accepted overall success of the new proﬁtability BI application in delivering important new capabilities which are detailed in the next section, the CYB managers who owned the application felt that it was falling short of meeting some of their expectations. After over 2 years in full operation, the new valuable customer groups had not been identiﬁed so that the quest for the promising customer segments remained unsatisﬁed. In 2008, one of the authors worked with CYB as a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) associate on developing a forecasting BI application which was expected to produce forward-looking measures of customer proﬁtability, including customer life-time value metrics, and was complimentary to the existing customer proﬁtability application. As part of a broader contribution of the KTP project, she was asked to investigate the existing customer proﬁtability BI application with the aim of establishing if this application captured and revealed all the important trends in customer proﬁtability which were present in the available data. The speciﬁc task was to interrogate the output proﬁtability data along with the primary input data to identify valuable customer groups which were potentially not adequately captured in the existing BI outputs. At this point in time, the customer proﬁtability BI application had been in full operation for over 2 years. A thorough data interrogation exercise, based on the BI application, was performed largely outside of the existing customer segmentation system. The exercise allowed the data to lead the analysis. A large volume of business analytics was produced at both summary and more detailed levels and presented to the CYB management. Experienced CYB managers, the head of Customer Knowledge and the Customer Insight manager, immediately spotted unusual (in the light of their perception and understanding at the time) features in the behavioral characteristics of some key customer groups. This motivated the next step, which we refer to as the KTP initiative, which involved a more focused investigation into these customer groups. The results of this investigation revealed that both the routine BI reporting and also ad-hoc intelligence which was produced on demand by the CYB analysts failed to uncover (a) some highly valuable customer groups and also (b) recent unfavorable changes in their behavior. This failure motivated our research project and also informed our research questions. Data collection The ﬁrst source of data for this study includes a series of semi-structured interviews that were conducted over a 6months period in 2008, shortly after the participating author had begun her KTP Associate role with CYB. Sixteen CYB staff were interviewed and included both

managers and specialists in all key stakeholder units, including the BI analysts within Customer Insight that owned the BI application, a larger Customer Knowledge team of which Customer Insight was a part and also product, marketing and communications teams that were either regular or on-demand users of the BI reporting and the database manager. The interviews lasted an hour, on average, and detailed notes were produced. The quotations cited in this paper therefore have been paraphrased from our notes. The questions of all interviews focused on the speciﬁcs of the BI use, BI beneﬁts and also associated issues. In addition to the interview data, the participating author had access to internal BI-related documentation, including the BI project and technical documentation, internal memorandums with development propositions, memos of relevant meetings and BI-based reporting and also attended regular internal meetings where various aspects of both day-to-day BI operation and related strategic developments were discussed, including one meeting with the representatives of the parent company. The relevant documentation, minutes and personal notes of these meetings and also of other organizational events and communications were collected throughout the duration of the KTP partnership in 2008 and 2009. Some documentation was classed as ‘conﬁdential’ and could not be stored; in such cases only brief personal notes that could provide relevant evidence but excluded conﬁdential information were kept. The ﬁndings of the preliminary stage of this research (the KTP initiative) were extensively discussed with the Customer Insight manager and the head of Customer Knowledge and subsequently presented to the heads of Retail Marketing and Marketing and Communications and also the business partner overlooking this business area who provided the senior management level view. This study was conducted outside of the main KTP project which had a distinctive purpose and was a complimentary development to the existing customer proﬁtability BI application. The work on the new application, however, facilitated the in-depth understanding of the data sources, information systems and the organizational environment which all provided background information for this study. Another important advantage of being part of the organization during the data collection and preliminary data analysis stages is that this gave practically unlimited access to the application itself and also to the key stakeholders, from Bank analysts operating the application to middlelevel and senior managers who used the output intelligence in both the operational and management decision-making processes. This allowed verifying our understanding and interpretation of the data during the preliminary data analysis stage. The direct involvement of the ﬁrst author with CYB points to her dual role as a practitioner and a researcher during her time at CYB which could potentially lead to undue inﬂuences on the research outcomes relating to the organizational politics and other factors leading to onesided or biased views (Coghlan & Brannick, 2001;

Heiskanen et al, 2008). Her primary role, however, was that of a researcher and this corresponded with how she was perceived by the CYB staff due to the following factors which also limited the potential for undue inﬂuences on the research. First, she was contracted as a facilitator of academic knowledge transfer between an independent academic institution, the University of Leeds, and CYB and formally employed by the University partner. Second, the KTP partnership was ﬁxed term (2 years) in duration which limited both the possibility and beneﬁts of involvement in organizational politics. Third, during the initial data collection stages, including the interview stage, the ﬁrst author was new to the organization so her perception was free from organizational inﬂuences. Also, her ‘newcomer’ role gave her the beneﬁt of being able to spot some organizational phenomena that potentially were invisible to the long-term CYB employees (Heiskanen et al, 2008). Finally, while at CYB, the ﬁrst author remained in regular contact with the second author who continuously questioned her interpretations of the data throughout this stage. The second author also devoted considerable time validating the data sources and interpretations of the ﬁrst author, ensuring that all key interpretations build on the perspectives of the organizational actors themselves and are supported at least by two or more pieces of information from primary data sources.

Data analysis Our data analysis was conducted in several stages during 2008–2013. Our preliminary analysis was broadly focused on the organizational factors that contributed to the postimplementation success (or otherwise) of the proﬁtability BI. The case data was carefully systemized and analyzed, particular attention was given to determining a comprehensive set of organizational factors that could be potentially linked to the failure of the BI application to deliver the expected beneﬁts in a strategically important area. These factors were rigorously analyzed independently by each author and then discussed by both authors to critically review our understanding. A detailed case study was written to facilitate both authors’ in-depth familiarity with the data. To ensure the correctness of our interpretation, the case study was sent to the Customer Insight manager who mostly agreed with our initial interpretations and suggested a few minor corrections that were implemented. At the next stage, the case data was revised and carefully analyzed using the lens of the organization’s deep structure and organizational inertia. This analysis focused on the links between each facet of the deep structure and BI success and the effects of organizational inertia. Table 1 gives an excerpt from our data analysis for the core beliefs facet of the deep structure and the success factors related to the company’s capability to apply BI to accomplish its strategic objectives in which relevant data is mapped to potential sources of organizational inertia. In this analysis, our explanation of the relevant concepts and their interrelations was guided by the theoretical interpretations of

the deep structure and the role of organizational inertia within the organizational change literature (following predominantly Tushman & Romanelli, 1985; Gersick, 1991) that were contextualized and linked (either explicitly as in Silva & Hirshheim, 2007; Besson & Rowe, 2012) or implicitly (as in, e.g., Sarker & Lee, 1999, Abraham & Junglas, 2011) to strategic IS developments. We adopted core notions of organizational inertia dimensions and used as guidance the related interpretations of conceptions of agent within the context of IS enabled organizational transformation from Besson & Rowe (2012) who draw on an extensive body of prior research in IS, strategy and organizational studies. This work helped to ﬁnalize our research questions and also served as an inspiration for developing our theoretical framework which focuses on the process of interaction between the BI and the organizational deep structure that supports the delivery of BI beneﬁts during its post-implementation use. Subsequently, our theoretical framework was applied to the case data to enable our interpretation. To ensure that we did not miss any important information, our data was searched manually for all references to relevant constructs from the literature that related to the organizational deep structure, organizational inertia, BI-enabled organizational transformation (change), alignment between the BI and the organization as a whole, including the business strategy, structures and processes, and also BI success factors and BI beneﬁts. This search was supplemented by an automated search using relevant key words from these

areas. The selected phrases were tabulated under each of the potentially relevant headings and next revised and carefully analyzed by both authors, this analysis was guided by our theoretical framework. At the ﬁnal stage, our conclusions were validated using the entire case study data.

Customer profitability BI application
Description of the customer proﬁtability BI The development of the customer proﬁtability BI application was initiated and overseen by the managers of the Customer Insight and Customer Knowledge teams. The relevant development work was outsourced to an external consultant and was conducted with the close involvement of the Customer Insight team. Input was also invited from other CYB stakeholders at key development stages. At the implementation stage, both the application and also the programming code for it were handed over to CYB so that the bank could easily tailor the application outputs to their current business needs. The analysts of the Customer Insight team also possessed adequate technical skills and were able to implement such changes. The Customer Insight team in effect was acting as the BI competency center that was facilitating the use of BI within the organization and also was able to adapt the BI outputs to their evolving needs. Customer Insight reported to the head of Customer Knowledge who oversaw the high-level strategic BI use.

The application integrated a regular feed of information from different sources across a number of business functions and databases which served as an input into the customer proﬁtability models. The model inputs were sourced from the customer personal (proﬁling) database, product and service databases containing information for each of the main product groups, the product and services costing model and the database containing records of customers’ one-off fees and charges. Relevant data from all sources were aggregated and integrated using the embedded proﬁtability models which produced up-to-date measures of proﬁtability of each of the CYB customers. The application used these measures in the estimation of proﬁtability of internal customer segments and other important customer groups and in the analysis of trends in customer behavior. The BI output included proﬁtability dashboards, analytical memorandums and other related intelligence which was produced both on a regular basis and in an ad-hoc manner for a number of different business users (Figure 2). In particular, the retail management units received business indicators reﬂecting their performance in the past period so that they could monitor and improve their performance on a regular basis. Proﬁtability dashboards for various internal marketing segments were directed to the marketing teams. Also, the BI could now be used for the accurate assessment of the impact of new product launches on overall customer proﬁtability which was important for the product development teams but previously was not feasible. The current and past proﬁtability measures were also planned to be used as an input into the new proﬁtability forecasting application which CYB was developing when this project took place. Finally, the bank steering and executive committees received intelligence which was tailored to speciﬁc current business objectives. In summary, the BI application was aligned with the business needs of CYB and assisted in the decision-making processes at both the operational and strategic

management levels. This BI development led to improvements in organizational efﬁciency and also gave the business new capabilities that allowed better understanding of their customer base and also the ability to monitor and respond rapidly to the most recent trends in customer behavior.

Implementation success Given the important beneﬁts and new capabilities that the customer proﬁtability application BI introduced to CYB, the application was perceived as a signiﬁcant overall success among its key stakeholders. We verify the objectivity of this perception using two alternative measures of BI implementation success. The application met all ﬁve evaluation criteria of Poon & Wagner (2001) that are drawn from the previous literature and combines the success criteria of Cottrell & Rapley (1991), Rainer & Watson (1995) and Rockart & DeLong (1988). Speciﬁcally, ﬁrst, the BI application was made available so that all intended users could access it: The BI analysts accessed the BI application directly whereas other organizational users received their BI information from the BI analysts. Second, the application has been continuously used by the intended users (Figure 2) over a considerable period of time, from the implementation in 2005 and for the foreseeable future at the time of writing. Third, all key users indicated their overall satisfaction with the BI; and, fourth, the application has had a signiﬁcant positive impact in a number of business areas as detailed in the previous section. The ﬁnal, diffusion, criteria was also satisﬁed as the number of internal users of the customer proﬁtability BI increased over time. The BI also attracted the attention of the parent company which was investigating the possibility of utilizing this application in its other businesses. While this set of ﬁve criteria is indicative of the overall success of BI, it fails to capture the issue that the CYB customer proﬁtability application did not reveal important ‘new information’ about customer behavior that Customer Knowledge managers were looking to discover. This aspect is better captured by the success measure of Sanders & Courtney (1985) that incorporates two different dimensions of user satisfaction. The ﬁrst criteria, the overall satisfaction, is met in line with the previous discussion involving the Poon & Wagner (2001) criteria set, whereas the second criteria, decision-making satisfaction, was only partially met in our case. Although most users were satisﬁed with the decision-making support that this application provided for day-to-day operations at both operational and executive levels, the decision makers who were expecting the BI to discover ‘new information’ to support CYB’s strategic objective of maximizing customer value were not entirely satisﬁed.

The KTP initiative
Our further data examination exercise, which was part of the KTP initiative, identiﬁed a key group of retail customers who, although constituting only about 4% of the

European Journal of Information Systems

39

retail customer population, contributed about 40% of the total retail proﬁts. Customers aged over 55 constituted almost half of this highly proﬁtable customer group. These highly proﬁtable 55 plus customers also had other favorable characteristics such as low credit risk and historically high loyalty to the CYB which distinguished this group from other proﬁtable customers groups. Even though the CYB management was aware of the high proﬁtability of this 55 plus customer group, they were astounded by its scale and the overall contribution of this customer group to the proﬁts of CYB. Another major discovery was that the bank’s perception of high loyalty among this customer group did not ﬁnd support in the recent data. One of the most important preconceptions in retail banking, a belief that older customers tend to stay loyal to their bank for life, has shaped retail banks’ customer acquisition and retention strategies for many years. The almost universally adopted strategy of high-street U.K. banks has been to focus on attracting and keeping young customers and to largely ignore loyal older customers, assuming that they would stay with the bank no matter what and, hence, required little attention (e.g., Lewis, 1982; Thwaites & Vere, 1995). The defection rate among the highly-proﬁtable sub-group of customers aged over 55 at CYB was, however, found to be considerably higher than the average for this customer group and was also high relative to other marketing segments. This was an alarming indication that the most proﬁtable and most safe customers were leaving the bank. The results led to a major shift in the bank’s marketing strategy involving both customer acquisition and retention strategies. While young people were still considered important, the mature customer segment, that had been historically overlooked, was given a strategically important status. A special steering committee consisting of key stakeholders within the bank was created to move forward this strategic development. An important question which arose from this exercise was why the valuable information concerned was not already known to the bank? The bank had systems and processes in place to ensure that the bank management had the most up-to date and accurate information. The customer proﬁtability application regularly produced accurate BI with the aims of monitoring the performance of internal customer segments and also identifying new trends in customer behavior.

to wider theory. A summary of our ﬁndings is given in Table 2.

Core beliefs Core beliefs to BI link The largely successful implementation of the BI proﬁtability application which aimed to enable the CYB strategic move to a customer centered as opposed to a product centered business model indicates the entrepreneurial attitude of the CYB management toward technology. The perceived implementation success and the new capabilities and efﬁciencies that the BI introduced also generated a positive general attitude toward the BI from both their owners and other stakeholders. This attitude was supported by the bank’s efforts to nurture an entrepreneurial mindset and a sense of ownership among the CYB employees. This is reﬂected in the ‘Always thinking …’ motto which was launched in 2008 and represents the CYB commitment to ‘always ﬁnd ways to improve, to add value and do the right thing for our customers, our employees and the environment’ (Clydesdale Bank, 2013). A series of internal events were also held in 2008 to promote these values. Despite these efforts, the BI data interrogation exercise revealed that the CYB internal customer marketing segmentation used a number of outdated assumptions about customer behavior (e.g., the high loyalty of mature customers) that were historically developed following industry practice. These outdated preconceptions prevailed at the organizational level and were embedded into the internal customer marketing segmentation which was part of the CYB business model. Accordingly, the BI reporting was also structured around these long-established internal marketing segments and could no longer capture some of the important developments in the customer data. As our BI data interrogation exercise has shown, the outdated assumptions about the customer behavior obstructed the discovery of important new information. To put it simply, the data needed to be ‘cut’ in a different way for this new information to be discovered. This illustrates how socio-cognitive inertia embedded in the organization’s core beliefs can impair the informative content of the BI outputs for the decision making at the strategic level and as a result, the organization’s capability to apply the BI to accomplish its strategic objectives. BI to core beliefs link The fact that the participating author conducting the BI data interrogation exercise only used information and data that was readily accessible to the CYB BI analysts indicates that despite its availability, this information had not been adequately captured in the BI outputs and hence, not integrated into the decisionmaking process. Furthermore, our analysis established little evidence of systematic processes aiming to verify the validity of the assumptions underlying the internal customer segmentation and serving as a basis for the BI-based analysis and reporting structures. The statistical description of marketing segments, for example, included only

Analysis
This section gives our interpretation of the CYB case study which is enabled by our theoretical framework that emphasizes the interaction between the deep structure and the BI. Our interpretation is structured around the two way links between the BI success factors and each of the CYB deep structure facets: core beliefs, distribution of power, control systems and organizational structure. We also offer general insights which discuss how the ﬁndings from our speciﬁc case study can be generalized and linked

Links between the deep structure and the BI Core values to BI: The bank used outdated, historically developed beliefs about customer behavior for their internal customer marketing segments that were also in-built into the BI analysis and reporting structures BI to Core values: Despite the ‘always thinking’ culture, the verification of the assumptions underlying the internal customer segmentation was lacking from the BI based analysis and reporting structures, so that no systematic feedback mechanism was established Organizational structures – BI The BI reporting structures were closely (statically) aligned with the organizational structures and the needs of different business users The job descriptions of BI analysts failed to include a set of important (quantitative data analysis) skills, so that the set of required skills was not appropriately matched with the nature and purpose of the BI. BI – Organizational structures: CYB lacked processes allowing the verification of the robustness of the existing reporting structures and pointing to potential problematic areas Distribution of power to BI: Even though the managers who owned the BI were not satisfied with the BI failure to detect new profitable customer segments, the underlying issues were not identified and could not be resolved until the KTP initiative took place and involved external expertise Distribution of power – BI: Once the BI related issues were detected with the help of an external expert, the top management acted promptly to move the ‘retirees initiative’ forward Control systems – BI: Existing control systems failed to detect an overalignment of the BI reporting structures with the customer segmentation which was part of the current business model. The BI capabilities were not fully exploited for information discovery BI – Control systems The BI capabilities had not been fully exploited as part of control mechanisms to ensure the robustness of both the assumptions underlying the business model and also the BI reporting structures

broad descriptors and lacked informative robustness indicators. As a result, an adequate feedback mechanism from the BI to the core beliefs of the deep structure had not been established.

General insights As the environment (e.g., customer expectations and customer behavior) changes over time, it is important to ensure that the assumptions underlying the business model and serving as a basis for the BI reporting are regularly veriﬁed and updated to overcome the effects of inertia. The importance of such evidencebased veriﬁcation extends to most organizations, including regulators. In particular, this need has been dramatically highlighted in the recent banking literature focused on the 2008–2009 global ﬁnancial crisis. The over-reliance on prior beliefs and ‘groupthink’ among central bankers and analysts contributed to their inability to foresee and prevent the crisis (Crowe, 2010; Buiter, 2012; Cobham, 2012). The evidence-based questioning and updating of business assumptions is therefore essential for organizations to ensure that the BI can continue capturing important developments in the organizational data and to deliver informative and relevant decision support. Furthermore, the CYB case indicates that the related questioning attitudes that were part of the CYB culture are important but not sufﬁcient; they need to be supported by business processes enabling such BI-based questioning and veriﬁcation. Organizational structures Organizational structures to BI link The existence of established processes ensuring the timely delivery of relevant BI information that informed the decision making of both CYB top and middle management in a number of business areas (Figure 2) provides evidence of the BI alignment with the business structures and processes (Sabherwal et al, 2001). The importance of alignment between IS and business processes for extracting the beneﬁts from IS is argued by Moreton (1995). A particular issue related to the BI failure to identify proﬁtable customer groups for the next round of customer acquisition and retention remained unresolved however until the involvement of an external expert who was contracted for a related but formally independent project. Our data analysis points to a number of related issues in organizational structures. Our BI data interrogation exercise revealed that a focused rigorous BI-based data analysis supported by advanced quantitative data analysis skills was required. The Customer Knowledge manager indicated however that their BI analysts did not possess sufﬁciently advanced data analysis skills to perform the task. Also, an analyst who operated the BI application expressed frustration that some customer segments appeared exceedingly heterogeneous, however, as she was fully loaded with regular duties, she did not have the time to investigate potential issues. The inability of the BI operating team to resolve this issue internally in a timely manner is therefore at least in

part related to the lack of speciﬁc (advanced quantitative data analysis) skills. Also, given the volume and complexity of the customer and other BI input data and its dynamic nature, which is associated with changes in data characteristics, regular access to such data analysis skills is essential for the BI operating team. Such skills however were not part of the relevant job speciﬁcation which can be explained by the historical development of the CYB structures: Customer Knowledge was part of the marketing function that traditionally relied on marketing analysts with predominantly qualitative data analysis skills. Even though the bank had employed and trained staff in the technical (programming) areas of BI, the quantitative data analysis aspect was not given adequate attention.

BI to organizational structures link The link from BI to the organizational structure can be classiﬁed as limited and static. The BI regular reporting contained an indirect but persistent indication of the issues with the BI reporting structures, for example, low homogeneity of some of the underlying internal marketing segments. This feature was known to the BI analysts as they acknowledged facing difﬁculties when attempting to produce a meaningful analysis of trends and developments in these segments for the proﬁtability dashboards; a more systematic analysis was required. The bank management also recognized this issue. In fact, CYB was conducting a business research project at the time of the KTP initiative with the aim of updating and reﬁning these segments. Surprisingly, the rich internal BI related data and the BI functionality were not exploited to their full capacity to investigate the issues. General insights Sanders & Courtney (1985) and Wixom & Watson (2001) also recognize highly skilled staff as an important factor and Finlay & Forghani (1998) emphasize the relevance of adequate technical skills. As a novel contribution to this literature, our study highlights that it is important to ensure that the nature of the key user skills is carefully matched to the speciﬁc BI application. The availability of highly skilled BI analysts with the right set of skills can be instrumental in overcoming inertia in relation to information from the BI as such experts are able to efﬁciently investigate signals of potential issues (e.g., scrutinize the analytical data in the CYB case), so that an organization can take timely steps in addressing these issues. Furthermore, our results indicate that an excessively close, static link between the BI and the organizational structures lead to strong socio-technical inertia which obstructs the BI from discovering new developments in the data. Consequently, this obstructs an organization from developing a BI-based capability to detect the need for change and act on it. Distribution of power Distribution of power to BI link The regular long-term (from the implementation in 2005 and into the

foreseeable future) use of the BI information by both middle and senior management to support their decision making in a number of business areas and their overall satisfaction conﬁrms that the BI has been delivering the decision-making beneﬁts in these areas. This along with the development of the new forecasting proﬁtability application which built on and complemented the existing BI and was championed by the same business owners indicates the senior management long-term commitment to the use of this BI. Also, technically, as Customer Knowledge (Customer Insight) had accessed, integrated and analyzed information from across different business units and this team’s analytical work was instrumental for the bank’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives, this warranted the team managers a special (strategic) position within the bank. As detailed in the previous section, however, despite the BI owners’ dissatisfaction with the BI performance in a strategically important area and their commitment to resolving this issue, it remained unresolved until much later. It indicates indirectly that the Customer Insight (Customer Knowledge) team required a more strategic status within the bank and, importantly, better resources to adequately deliver their roles which indicates the potential presence of political inertia and also economic inertia.

model to be revealed. For example, a number of the CYB customer segments were found to have low homogeneity in some important customer characteristics which were not directly used for segmentation (e.g., the customer defection rate). Any changes in such characteristics that did not notably affect the proﬁtability distribution within a segment were very difﬁcult to spot given the established BI reporting. It turned out that the highly proﬁtable 55 plus customer group was distributed across four distinct internal segments and it was problematic to distinguish these sub-groups from the rest of the population in these segments using the regular BI reporting. The marketing managers were also aware of the low homogeneity issue. One manager, for example, noted in relation to high-value customer segments: ‘There is a problem with segments … not enough segmentation. The segments include very different customer groups, with different attitudes and cultural differences’. The CYB control systems however failed to introduce procedures that could detect the over-alignment with the outdated segmentation system. Also, rich BI data and its capabilities were not fully exploited in setting up or updating customer segments. The lack of such procedures and the BI under-exploitation are both linked with the organizational maturity BI success factor.

BI to distribution of power link Once the issues that hindered the discovery of strategically important information were identiﬁed, both the BI owners and the bank executives acted promptly to move the ‘retirees initiative’ and the related changes to the bank marketing strategy forward. This initiative was championed by the BI owners and supported across other relevant CYB teams. General insights We found only indirect evidence pointing to a potential impact of organizational inertia associated with the distribution of power facet of the deep structure. This contrasts with Silva & Hirschheim (2007) whose case study is conducted in a public health services setting and ﬁnds the impact of the distribution of power important. As they focus on the strategic IS implementation as opposed to the BI post-implementation use in our study, the differences in ﬁndings may reﬂect different organizational contexts and also the speciﬁc organizational and IS (BI) development stages. Further research is required to obtain conclusive evidence. Control systems Control systems to BI link The structuring of the routine BI reporting around the CYB internal customer segments ensured consistency with the current business model, and this alignment allowed the BI to meet a number of CYB’s business needs. Our evidence suggests, however, that these BI reporting structures were too closely aligned with the existing customer segmentation and hence, the business model. Such over-alignment gave rise to socio-technical inertia as it gave little opportunity for any important information that did not conform to the current business

BI to control systems link The lack of the BI-based feedback mechanism, for example, ‘reality checks’, or reliability indicators, that allow detecting if the actual developments in the business data deviated from the assumed scenarios implied that that the BI was not incorporated into the systematic monitoring process of the robustness of the current business model and the related business assumptions about the external environment. Also, regular BI outputs (e.g., analytical information in the marketing dashboards) needed more systematic and indepth scrutinizing to be able to point to potential issues. General insights Our analysis of the CYB case conﬁrms that any business system can become outdated over time and it needs regular up-dating as it only reﬂects business knowledge which was available at the time of its creation. To enable such up-dating, rich BI data and its capabilities can be used for the ‘discovery’ of new information (e.g., for informing an updated customer segmentation as in our case) as opposed to using ‘manually’ pre-set structures which are either historically formed or rooted in the existing business model. Even if these structures are up-to-date but applied too closely, by construction, they will obstruct discovery of new information as the environment evolves. Any new segmentation system that the BI application might adopt therefore could only provide a temporary solution unless it was continuously veriﬁed and updated. The BI capabilities allow the BI reporting to be constructed to include such veriﬁcation and also provide signals when the current system becomes outdated and trigger the updating of this system. The introduction of processes that support these mechanisms would allow managing inertia

in respect to information from the BI and therefore enable the BI to continuously provide timely and informative decision support. For example, an introduction of the BI-based feedback mechanism that incorporates ‘reality checks’ or reliability indicators enables early detection of situations where the actual business data characteristics deviate from the assumed business scenarios. Signiﬁcant deviations should lead to an in-depth data interrogation to verify and update both the business assumptions and the BI reporting structures. This potential solution is also generalizable to other retail banks and organizations operating in fast changing environments. In contrast, as in the CYB case, an excessively close alignment between the BI reporting structures and the business model leads to reproducing information that is already well known while missing new important developments in the business data, and therefore re-enforcing existing preconceptions without pointing to a problem. It follows from our analysis that to enable the BI adjustment, BI needs to be adaptive not only during the development stage (e.g., Finlay & Forghani, 1998; Poon & Wagner, 2001) but also during the post-implementation phase. This adaptability condition was met in our case as the CYB customer proﬁtability BI could be easily adjusted to accommodate the updated customer segmentation and introduce new robustness indicators if needed.

Discussion of general insights Our ﬁndings contribute to the organizational transformation and the BI beneﬁts literatures by examining how the organization’s deep structure and also processes that embed the BI into an organization as a whole inﬂuence the long-term strategic beneﬁts from the BI such as better management decision making and the organization’s ability to use the BI for the accomplishment of its strategic business objectives (Table 2). The adoption of our theoretical framework that highlights the links between the organization’s deep structure and multidimensional inertia has allowed us to establish that a good quality BI, its alignment with the business strategy and business structures along with other established BI success factors are important but not sufﬁcient for the BI to be able to deliver expected BI beneﬁts in the long run. The ability to extract these beneﬁts is also inﬂuenced by the organization’s deep structure and, importantly, by the organization’s ability to overcome the effects of multidimensional organizational inertia that the deep structure generates. Our case study analysis further indicates that organizational processes that link the BI to the deep structure can be used to manage the effects of organizational inertia with respect to information from the BI. From a practical process development perspective, processes that enable a dynamic interaction (as opposed to a static link) between the BI and the organization’s deep structure can be used to manage the effects of organizational inertia in respect to information from the BI and support a dynamic (re-) alignment, both internal and external. First, this

interaction process supports the dynamic alignment between the BI and the organization which is often a lengthy process and can be viewed as a ‘moving target’ at which companies shoot with varying success (Thompson, 1967, p. 234). Even if an adequate alignment has been achieved, the evolving nature of the environment implies that the BI will need to adjust over time in response to changing business models and business needs, and consequently related changes in the deep structure. Furthermore, a gradual and continuous BI-driven optimization in organizational processes and structures may be required over a long-term horizon as the organization’s learning and capabilities build over time, driven by better understanding of information interdependencies and communication among different types of BI stakeholders (Seddon et al, 2010; Abraham & Junglas, 2011). Second, as BI plays a key role in information discovery regarding changes in the environment, the establishment of a feedback mechanism between the BI and the deep structure is important for (a) monitoring the robustness of assumptions (e.g., about customer behavior and customer expectations) underlying the organization’s business model and (b) timely signaling when these assumptions no longer reﬂect the reality. This process supports an organization’s ability to recognize and respond to the need for change and leads to the adjustments in the alignment over time. A company may be pushed to re-formulate its business strategy and re-align its deep structure if, for example, signiﬁcant changes in customer behavior or customer expectations are detected. In the CYB case, in particular, such processes would help to fully institutionalize its important core beliefs and values that encouraged evidence-based questioning and entrepreneurial attitudes and better align them with the BI (Table 2, Part a). Our results extend an argument in the organizational transformation literature (Besson & Rowe, 2012) that it is essential to understand the effects of the multidimensional organizational inertia by detailing these effects for the case of long-term BI use and also proposing how the inertia factors can be managed to enable the delivery of long-term BI beneﬁts. Our ﬁndings also emphasize that the dynamic view of the alignment process proposed by Sabherwal et al (2001) is relevant not only during the implementation process as widely acknowledged in BI studies (e.g., Poon & Wagner, 2001; Salmeron & Herrero, 2005; Arnott, 2008) but also during the longterm post-implementation use. Even if appropriate alignment is achieved at implementation, changes in the environment necessitate continuous re-alignment. Overalignment generates strong inertia and leads to failure when business conditions suddenly change (Tushman & O’Reilly, 1996; Sabherwal et al, 2001). Our ﬁndings also extend this literature by highlighting the role of the BI and its links with the organizational deep structure in developing the BI-based organizational capability to detect the need for change and respond to it, thereby ensuring the organization’s on-going alignment with the environment.

Our novel contribution to studies of BI beneﬁts is in extending the analysis from a short-term to long-term horizon and identifying a number of factors that are important for extracting long-term BI beneﬁts. These factors include the need for the BI owner to hold a strategic position within the organization and have access to adequate resources; a careful match between the set of users’ skills and the needs of a speciﬁc BI; and also the need for a BI to remain adaptive during its post-implementation use. Our discussion of the organizational processes that support long-term BI beneﬁts also expands the understanding of the ‘organizational maturity’ success factor.

Conclusions
This paper has aimed to advance our understanding of the important issue of how to maximize the beneﬁts from a BI application. We have formulated a theoretical framework of analysis which is based on previous research into organizational change and uses organizational deep structure and organizational inertia constructs. We apply our framework to a case study of a U.K. retail bank which used an existing customer proﬁtability BI application to transform its marketing strategy. As anticipated in our analysis, the organization’s ability to extract long-term BI beneﬁts is inﬂuenced by the deep structure (core beliefs, organizational structures, control mechanisms and potentially distribution of power) that generates multidimensional organizational inertia. The organizational links that embed the BI into the deep structure, if not adequately designed, can enforce the effects of inertia which obstructs the delivery of expected BI beneﬁts. The effects of interrelated inertia dimensions therefore should be carefully considered when such links are developed and maintained, with an aim of overcoming their effects in respect of information from the BI. It is important for such links to enable not only appropriate alignment of the BI with the organization as a whole but also the organization’s (re-) alignment with the evolving environment by supporting the BI-based capability to detect and respond to the change in the business environment. Our ﬁnding of the importance of the deep structure for the organization’s ability to extract strategic BI beneﬁts is in line with Silva & Hirschheim (2007) who also ﬁnd

control systems and core values important for the case of strategic information systems. Their third important facet, distribution of power, is not as apparent in our study where organizational structures seem more crucial. Overall our ﬁndings conﬁrm that the context of a study is likely to be important and worthy of further investigation, as discussed below. The differences in ﬁndings may reﬂect the speciﬁc nature of the IT (strategic information systems in Silva & Hirschheim (2007) as opposed to BI in our study), industry (Elbashir et al, 2008), organization-speciﬁc timing (Silva & Hirschheim, 2007) and the BI exploitation stage (Purvis et al, 2001; Seddon et al, 2010). Case study work necessarily has limitations as well as beneﬁts with potential issues of bias or undue inﬂuences on the research, particularly when researchers are based within the organizations being studied. We have, however, gone to considerable lengths to minimize these issues as detailed in our methodology section. Also, the successful and proﬁtable development which followed from the preliminary stage of this research, after the participating author’s involvement with the organization has ended, supports the objectivity of our analysis. Our ﬁndings highlight the need for further research into the links between the BI beneﬁts and the deep structure that explicitly accounts for the effect of multiple inertia dimensions. The research with a focus on different organizational contexts and also BI exploitation stages would allow systemizing the evidence for further theoretical development. One would expect that our framework of analysis would be useful in many other organizations. Developing a greater understanding of organizational factors that enable maximizing the long-term BI beneﬁts represents a valuable direction for future research.
