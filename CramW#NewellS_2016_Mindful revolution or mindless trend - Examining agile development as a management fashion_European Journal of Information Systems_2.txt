Abstract The growing adoption of agile methods of system development can be seen as broadly consistent with characteristics of a management fashion. However, the extent that fashions relate to how specific organizations actually adopt and use agile remains unclear. Based on five case studies, this research seeks to apply the concepts from management fashion theory to understand how organizations mindfully (or mindlessly) adopt agile methods. We find in some cases that agile appears to be characterized as a short-term, transitory trend, while in others it is embedded in an organization’s processes and culture. We identify three categories that distinguish between fashion patterns during agile adoptions: Crusaders, who exclusively adopt agile in a pure form; Tailors, who integrate agile and traditional approaches to fit their specific circumstances; and Dabblers who employ a few ceremonial agile activities alongside a traditional approach. The results from this study can encourage managerial awareness of the link between fashions and agile development, which can serve to highlight the unique opportunities to enhance mindfulness and avoid the pitfalls of mindlessness. By uncovering insights into the fashion-centric drivers of agile adoption, this research extends past theory related to both mindful innovation and management fashions.

Introduction
The increasingly mainstream adoption of agile software development in recent years has resulted in many organizations transitioning away from a plan-driven, waterfall approach (Cao et al, 2009; De Cesare et al, 2010; West & Grant, 2010). Agile refers to a family of iterative systems development methods that value team collaboration, minimal up-front planning, and the ﬂexibility to adapt to changing requirements (Beck et al, 2001). Each organization’s decision to adopt agile stems from a variety of factors, including the desire to improve efﬁciency, negative experiences with other development approaches, and pressure from stakeholders to adopt innovative development approaches (Mangalaraj et al, 2009; Maruping et al, 2009; Senapathi & Srinivasan, 2012). Although the perceived beneﬁts of agile have been widely reported (Chow & Cao, 2007; De Cesare et al, 2010), opposing views that challenge the hype surrounding agile have noted examples of deployment difﬁculties, ambiguous beneﬁts, and lack of project ownership (Balijepally et al, 2009; Laanti et al, 2011;

Drury et al, 2012; Janes & Succi, 2012). In addition, many organizations are avoiding a ‘by the book’ adoption of agile and are instead customizing agile techniques (Fitzgerald et al, 2006; Conboy & Fitzgerald, 2010) or employing agile alongside other development methods (Cao et al, 2009; Port & Bui, 2009; West & Grant, 2010). Although past research has investigated the practicalities of agile customization and adaptation, it remains unclear what factors are driving this adoption variability and how the use of agile techniques differs from project to project. This research positions management fashion theory as one possible explanation by suggesting that management techniques created by consultants, authors, and academics are continually disseminated to organizations and are presented as novel approaches to drive performance and innovation; however, after a period of rising popularity, the techniques are eventually abandoned in favor of a newly emerging fashion (Abrahamson, 1991; Abrahamson, 1996; Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). Past research has applied a fashion theory lens to general management techniques such as quality circles and total quality management, as well as information systems techniques such as service-oriented architecture and computer-aided software engineering (Lawler & Mohrman, 1985; Baskerville & Myers, 2009; Hirschheim et al, 2012). We suggest that at least some aspects of management fashions are present in virtually all adoptions of a new systems development approach, such as the belief that an approach is highly efﬁcient or advanced (Abrahamson, 1996; Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). However, rather than simply evaluating if agile is a management fashion, this research seeks to use the concepts from management fashion theory to understand how organizations adopt and use agile methods. A key factor driving the acceptance of an innovation is the degree that its adoption exhibits characteristics of mindfulness (e.g. reluctance to simplify complex situations, vigilance in attending to small operational details) or mindlessness (e.g. lack of attention to speciﬁcs, contentedness to be a follower) (Fiol & O’Connor, 2003; Swanson & Ramiller, 2004). Mindful approaches to innovation represent an opportunity to drive improved performance, support improved decision making, and improve the speed of issue detection (Butler & Gray, 2006). Although the development practices that are consistent with a mindful agile adoption have been examined in past research (Matook & Kautz, 2008; Vidgen & Wang, 2009; McAvoy et al, 2013), it remains unclear what factors actually inﬂuence a company to mindfully (or mindlessly) adopt agile, as well as the practical impact that these different approaches have on the ongoing use of the innovation. As a ﬁrst step in addressing this gap, this research considers the role of management fashions. We pose two related research questions: How do macrolevel management fashion indicators relate to ﬁrm-level adoptions of agile development? Do variations in the impact of different management fashion indicators at the ﬁrm level relate to whether agile adoptions can be characterized as mindful or mindless? Using 42 interviews with systems developers and

managers at ﬁve organizations, we employ a qualitative case study approach to analyze the perspectives of those involved in the adoption and use of agile. Drawing on past research, we investigate ﬁve factors that indicate the existence of a management fashion: norms of progress, norms of rationality, socio-economic forces, technoeconomic forces, and innovation devolution (Abrahamson, 1996; Zbaracki, 1998; Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999; Carson et al, 1999; Benders & van Veen, 2001). Based on patterns within the fashion indicators across the cases, we assess the extent that an innovation adoption can be characterized as mindful or mindless in order to examine the opportunities and risks related to agile adoptions. The adoption and use of agile has been steadily increasing over the past decade, positioning it as a fundamentally important driver of productivity and performance within many of today’s IT departments (West & Grant, 2010). Even if this momentum wanes in the future, organizations remain concerned with making systems development choices today that enhance their future opportunities for projects that are on time, in scope, and within budget. One key decision, the adoption and use of a particular development approach, is commonly seen to be driven by projectlevel factors such as team size or system complexity (Boehm & Turner, 2003; Nerur et al, 2005; Vinekar et al, 2006). However, additional macro-level factors such as management fashions may also inﬂuence these decisions. Such technical innovations can aid organizations in improving their reputation and long-term performance (Wang, 2010), but may also encourage inefﬁciency, deplete competitiveness and restrict organizational learning (Abrahamson, 1991; Hirschheim et al, 2012). By considering how fashions relate to the adoption and use of agile, as well as the corresponding degree of mindfulness, this research can help organizations reﬂect on what they seek to gain from agile methods and how institutionalized agile should become in their processes. These longer-term perspectives can aid managers in extending beyond a short-term, project-by-project view of agile to increasingly consider the strategies and trends that can be leveraged in relation to agile development. The remainder of the paper is as follows. In the following section, we provide an overview of agile development and management fashion theory. Next, we outline our methodology, including the data collection and analysis approach. The results are then presented and discussed, including the connection with mindful innovations. We conclude by presenting a series of future research opportunities.

Background and theoretical base
This research focuses on agile systems development approaches in the context of management fashions. We ﬁrst outline the core concepts and history of agile development and then highlight the fundamentals of management fashion theory. These two elements are integrated through the argument that management fashions can help us better understand organizational adoption and use of

agile. Based on this foundation, we then present a framework of ﬁve management fashion indicators that form a base for our analysis of the empirical data.

Agile development Agile development refers to a collection of software development practices that fundamentally differ from a plandriven, waterfall approach. Widespread awareness of agile originated in 2001 with the release of the Agile Manifesto by a group of 17 practitioners who sought to establish a better way of developing software. The Manifesto established a core philosophy based on the importance of individuals and interactions, the incremental delivery of working software, collaboration with customers, and responding to changes (Beck et al, 2001). Twelve underlying principles were included in the manifesto, including the use of face-to-face conversations, maintaining a constant pace, technical excellence, and self-organizing teams. A variety of speciﬁc methods that operationalize and provide guidance on the agile philosophy include eXtreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Crystal Methods, and Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM). These methods prescribe speciﬁc practices, such as pair programming, daily stand-up meetings, shared code ownership, and retrospective project evaluations. Past research in the ﬁeld has examined the effectiveness and beneﬁts, as well as the practical challenges, of adopting such practices (Balijepally et al, 2009; Maruping et al, 2009; Drury et al, 2012). In considering the rise of agile development as an alternative to more traditional development methods, a key sub-category of agile development research examines the adaptation of the approach (Cao et al, 2009; Port & Bui, 2009; Conboy & Fitzgerald, 2010). Organizations can tailor their development methodologies by adopting a contingency approach (e.g. one of a collection of possible methods is chosen, depending on the project context), a method engineering approach (e.g. methods are constructed from a set of pre-deﬁned method components), or an a la carte approach (e.g. fragmented elements of a method or group of methods are selected for use together) (Fitzgerald et al, 2006). This line of inquiry is of particular interest to those organizations that perceive value in the agile approach, but are reluctant to fully abandon traditional waterfall techniques or follow a prescribed set of guidelines. Research suggests that the initial adoption of agile is driven by considerations including project size, application criticality, complexity, employee skillset, and company culture (Boehm & Turner, 2003; Nerur et al, 2005; Vinekar et al, 2006). In situations where agile is employed alongside a traditional development approach, challenges related to conﬂicting values, unclear employee expectations, and confused management styles can surface (Nerur et al, 2005; Vinekar et al, 2006). Although evidence exists that some organizations may be able to adopt agile techniques alongside techniques from other methodologies (Boehm & Turner, 2003; Holmstrom et al, 2006; Port & Bui, 2009; Vinekar et al, 2006), other research

suggests that agile techniques that are adapted to better suit a development process, developer style, customer, and organization may ease an organization’s transition away from a traditional approach (Fitzgerald et al, 2006; Cao et al, 2009). Characteristics such as a description and rationale for method practices and a familiarity with a range of methods have been shown to improve the effectiveness of methodology tailoring (Conboy & Fitzgerald, 2010). Despite the growing use of agile in practice, academic research was initially slow to respond and has only picked up in recent years (Dyba & Dingsoyr, 2008; Abrahamsson et al, 2009). Special journal issues, such as the European Journal of Information Systems (2009) and The Journal of Systems and Software (2012), have raised the proﬁle of agileoriented research. Although some work in the ﬁeld has been criticized for lacking a strong theoretical and conceptual base (Conboy, 2009; Wang et al, 2012), the variety of theoretical perspectives is growing, with knowledge management and personality-related foundations being the most prevalent (Dingsoyr et al, 2012). Some suggest that agile is simply a passing fashion (Sharp et al, 2006; Janes & Succi, 2012; Moczar, 2013), while others suggest that it is here to stay because of its superior speed and ﬂexibility relative to alternatives (Nerur et al, 2005; Holmstrom et al, 2006; De Cesare et al, 2010; Dingsoyr et al, 2012). However, rather than debating if agile is broadly characteristic of a fashion, we consider the possibility that this might be a ﬁrm-dependent variable, with some organizations adopting agile in a way that suggests the approach is merely a transitory phase, while in other organizations agile is adopted in a way that suggests it is becoming or already is a permanent (and institutionalized) approach. We consider this possibility through the lens of management fashion theory, which is discussed next.

Management fashion theory This research considers the growth of agile development in the context of management fashion theory, which refers to transitory beliefs that particular management techniques lead to a rational management progress (Abrahamson, 1991; Abrahamson, 1996; Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). Consistent with Abrahamson & Fairchild (1999) and Baskerville & Myers (2009), this deﬁnition is neutral on the merit of management fashions and remains open to the possibility of positive and/or negative consequences from adopting a fashion. Building on the theory of adoption and diffusion (Rogers, 1995), management fashion theory argues that new organizational techniques are inﬂuenced by factors including the rhetoric of inﬂuential gurus, research funding bodies, and practitioner demand for innovative solutions to practical problems (Abrahamson, 1991; Abrahamson, 1996; Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999; Newell et al, 2001). Fashions are initiated by organizations and individuals (e.g. consultants, gurus, authors, academics) who continuously create and distribute management knowledge. As this knowledge is disseminated to organizations, some managers (though not

all) will perceive the new techniques as being superior to the current techniques and feel compelled to iteratively adopt a new approach (Abrahamson, 1991; Abrahamson, 1996), which is subsequently replaced as new fashions emerge. Examinations of management fashions point to a process whereby a management technique is invented (or reinvented), a period of latency, a popularity surge, then a gradual falling out of favor (Kieser, 1997; Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999; Carson et al, 1999). In contrast to popular perceptions of clothing fashions, which may only last a year or two, the lifecycle of a management fashion can extend for a period of 20 years (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). Although this perspective can be helpful in examining macro-level trends, it is unclear if applying a management fashion lens can be helpful in better understanding what inﬂuences ﬁrm-level adoptions, such as agile development. A variety of internal and external triggers can shape management fashions, including perceived consistency with organizational structures, the organizing vision of the innovation, individuals’ psychological needs, or the emergence of a new fashion (Abrahamson, 1996; Swanson & Ramiller, 1997; Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). The rise of a new management fashion can be triggered in circumstances such as when an existing management fashion is no longer viewed as being effective or another management technique is perceived as needing to address a performance gap (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). If a fashion rises in popularity but the anticipated performance improvements are not achieved, counter-fashions may emerge that reverse the approach of the initial technique (e.g. decentralization to centralization, outsourcing to insourcing) (Kieser, 1997). Past investigations of general management fashions consider a range of trends including business process reengineering, total quality management, and quality circles (Newell et al, 1998; Zbaracki, 1998; Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). Although these studies recognize the negative implications of adopting management fashions, such as restricted organizational learning, lower short-term performance, and inefﬁciency, positive outcomes are also noted including improved organizational reputation, long-term performance, and facilitating political manoeuvers (Abrahamson, 1991; Kieser, 1997; Newell et al, 1998; Baskerville & Myers, 2009; Wang, 2010; Hirschheim et al, 2012). In fact, some research suggests that transitory management fashions are more pervasive within organizations than stable, institutionalized techniques (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). As a result, we avoid characterizing an organization’s adoption of a management fashion as either ‘good’ or ‘bad’; evidence exists that fashions can contribute to both positive and negative organizational outcomes. Rather, we seek to consider how the elements that indicate the existence of a management fashion (discussed below) relate to ﬁrm-level adoptions, in order to evaluate if an adoption can be characterized as mindful or mindless and pervasive or transitory, recognizing that perhaps these aspects of adoption are not necessarily tightly related.

The concept of mindfulness builds on social psychology principles to aid in better understanding how individuals process information and behave in social situations (Langer et al, 1978; Langer, 1989b). Where a state of mindfulness exists, qualities of openness and alertness are present, which is in contrast to a mindless state of ‘tuning out’ and ignoring new information (Langer et al, 1978; Langer, 1989a; Langer, 1997). When considered within an organizational and information systems setting, the role of mindfulness has been applied to topics including learning (Levinthal & Rerup, 2006; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006), innovation (Swanson & Ramiller, 2004; Mu & Butler, 2009), and reliability (Vogus & Welbourne, 2003; Butler & Gray, 2006). In such contexts, mindful actions may take the form of a reluctance to simplify complex situations and a vigilance in attending to small operational details, while mindless actions demonstrate a lack of attention to speciﬁcs and contentedness to be a follower (Swanson & Ramiller, 2004). Within the information systems discipline, topics such as e-commerce, enterprise resource planning systems, service-oriented architecture, knowledge management, group decision support systems, and computer-aided software engineering have been investigated in the context of management fashion theory (Westrup, 2003; Ramiller et al, 2008; Baskerville & Myers, 2009; Hirschheim et al, 2012). This body of research suggests that the fundamentals of management fashions apply within IS, though distinctions such as higher switching costs associated with investments in hardware and software make IS fashions somewhat unique (Baskerville & Myers, 2009; Wang, 2010). Building on Abrahamson’s deﬁnition, an IS fashion is deﬁned as ‘a relatively transitory collective belief in IS research and practice, disseminated by fashion setters, that a technique or technology leads to rational IS innovation’ (Baskerville & Myers, 2009, p. 649). Much of the past management fashion literature adopts a macro-level perspective that considers the trajectory along which a new technique is adopted or abandoned using approaches such as citation analysis (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999; Baskerville & Myers, 2009; Hirschheim et al, 2012). However, the extent that fashions relate to ﬁrm-level adoption of management techniques remains relatively unclear, despite calls for alternative approaches that adopt such perspectives (Zbaracki, 1998; Clark, 2004). We seek to address this gap by examining the links between management fashion concepts and the adoption of agile development methods.

Considering agile as a fashion that can impact mindfulness Although management fashion theory is only one of many perspectives that can generate new insights into agile adoption and use (Dingsoyr et al, 2012), we suggest that it can contribute unique insights. Drawing on management fashion concepts to understand how organizations adopt and use agile can add a new perspective to the current literature, which tends to focus on employing

development methods on the basis of project-speciﬁc factors such as goals, size, customer relations, problemsolving approach, and learning type (Boehm & Turner, 2003; Nerur et al, 2005; Nerur & Balijepally, 2007). Although we agree that these factors are key in aligning a development approach with the task at hand, fashion theory presents a collection of unique, macro-level factors that also inﬂuence ﬁrm-level development decisions. Since fashion theory focuses on speciﬁc concepts (e.g. rationality, rhetoric, psychological needs), it cannot fully explain all aspects of how agile is adopted and used. However, we believe that fashion theory presents a new, longer-term perspective that managers can consider when making decisions about the relative beneﬁts of agile (e.g. are there other development approaches that are more suitable for the organization?), the ongoing use of agile (e.g. will we continue to use agile in ﬁve years?), and the extent that agile techniques are institutionalized (e.g. is agile our standard, accepted approach to development?). We suggest that at least some general aspects of agile development are consistent with past management fashion characterizations. For example, the Agile Manifesto could be viewed as a widely cited rhetorical discourse that justiﬁes and promotes the use of the agile approach. The broad awareness of the Manifesto is consistent with the view that management fashions are supported via a dissemination of knowledge from fashion-setting sources (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999) – in this case, prominent practitioners. This has been further supplemented by increasing academic and practitioner interest, as evidenced by journal special issues and publications in a range of technology and management outlets. This growing body of agile literature is consistent with past patterns of management fashions, which typically lag behind in generating attention from the popular press (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). Benders & van Veen (2001) also point to an appealing name or label as being indicative of a management fashion. Since the term ‘agile’ is associated with speed and responsiveness, the approach is appealing to organizations. In connecting these agile characteristics with management fashion theory, we adopt an exploratory approach that speciﬁes the constructs of interest, but does not make predictions based on theory (Dube & Pare, 2003). Speciﬁcally, we draw on past research to identify a widely used collection of generic management fashion indicators and apply them to an agile development context (see Table 1). We posit that nearly all innovations that are adopted by organizations will contain at least some evidence of the indicators listed below. However, it is unclear if patterns within these fashion indicators may characterize a mindful vs mindless agile adoption and whether this is directly related to a transitory vs more institutionalized adoption at the ﬁrm level. In total, ﬁve indicators are identiﬁed within the literature. The ﬁrst indicator is the norm of progress, which suggests that new management techniques will be adopted because they are seen as novel innovations (Abrahamson, 1996). Due to ongoing demands for

improved performance, this indicator suggests that managers will choose techniques that appear to represent continuing improvement. In some cases, an innovation may be adopted based on the norm of progress, alongside supporting evidence and careful consideration that the advancement is genuine; however, in more transitory, fashion-centric scenarios, an innovation may be adopted principally due to the fact that it is perceived as being cutting edge, without careful consideration of the evidence to support such claims at the ﬁrm level. In either case, an organization’s engagement with an innovative technique can signal to stakeholders that progress and advancement is being made (Wang, 2010). The second indicator, the norm of rationality, suggests that new management techniques will be adopted when they are presented by others as representing the most efﬁcient approach available (Abrahamson, 1996). Drawing from Meyer and Rowan’s (1977) view of neo-institutional theory, this indicator assumes that managers and employees will choose to act in a rational manner by following the conclusions of outside experts. As gurus and academics promote a new management technique as being superior to previous approaches, the norms of rationality suggest that the new technique will be adopted in order to act in the best interests of the organization. Whereas the norm of progress indicator suggests that a technique is desirable solely on the basis that is new, the norm of rationality indicator argues that a technique is desirable because it performs better than the alternatives. Although the norms of rationality and progress are viewed as being conceptually distinct, we recognize that some companies will adopt a technique on the basis that it is both new and more efﬁcient than the alternatives. However, where accepting the performance conclusions of fashionsetters at face value may indicate a management fashion, this should be distinguished from a scenario where an organization adopts a management technique on the basis of fashionsetter conclusions, but also conducts its own independent analysis. It such cases, an organization may well be mindfully adopting a technique on the basis of its merits, rather than simply following the path advocated by others. The socio-psychological forces indicator refers to the increased demand of a management innovation based on the perception that it fulﬁlls individuals’ psychological needs, such as individuality, novelty, and status (Abrahamson, 1996). This indicator argues that managers will gravitate towards new techniques in order to deviate from the status quo and be perceived as being fashionable and progressive. In doing so, this indicator also encompasses an individual’s desire to avoid the anxiety caused by organizational performance gaps by suppressing these psychological pressures through exaggerating the potential value of the innovation as a quasi-magical and all-powerful solution for the organization’s problems (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). Although such scenarios would be consistent with a management fashion, there may be other situations where an innovation is adopted on the basis that it is a genuine complement to the social and psychological characteristics of employees. Although such scenarios would remain

Innovation devolution

New management techniques will be adopted because they are seen as novel innovations. New management techniques will be adopted when they are presented by others as representing the most efficient approach available. The demand for management innovations will increase when they are perceived as fulfilling individuals’ psychological needs. The demand for management innovations will increase when they are perceived as being consistent with economic fluctuations, political perspectives, and organizational structure or culture. A management technique that begins as an authentic technical intervention, but devolves into ambiguous and dubious inventions that provide little value aside from perceived legitimacy.

consistent with the management fashion indicator, it would suggest the technique’s adoption would be increasingly consistent with mindful decision-making. The fourth indicator, techno-economic forces, refers to the increased demand of a management innovation that is perceived as being consistent with economic ﬂuctuations, political perspectives, and organizational structure or culture (Abrahamson, 1996; Carson et al, 1999). Where such management technique characteristics are perceived as complementing the internal characteristics of the organization, they become more desirable and are pursued more strongly, which can indicate consistency with a management fashion. Although this could suggest a temporary fashion that is rapidly passed over for another trend that follows a subsequent technoeconomic ﬂuctuation, an organization may rationally adopt an innovation due to longer-term, pervasive trends that would be less characteristic of transitory fashions. Finally, the innovation devolution indicator refers to management techniques that begin as authentic technical interventions, but devolve (after adoption by an organization) into ambiguous and dubious inventions that provide little value aside from perceived legitimacy (Zbaracki, 1998). Where organizations adopt an innovation ceremonially, but fail to integrate the core elements, the technique will lose power and become consistent with a management fashion. This indicator also draws on the concept of interpretive viability (Benders and van Veen, 2001), which suggests that where there is some degree of conceptual ambiguity in a management technique, organizations can opportunistically select only those elements that apply to them and reinterpret the fashion’s core idea to align with their own needs. Although interpretive viability can be applied as a driver for increased diffusion of a fashion, it can also apply as a driver of innovation devolution. In some cases, interpretive viability may be a response to an innovation that requires customization to align with an organization’s internal or external characteristics and needs; however, when the innovation is adapted

to such a point that it begins to lose the spirit of its initial conceptualization, it devolves into a management fashion. We argue that at least some of the ﬁve management fashion indicators discussed above are inherent in the adoption of most management techniques. However, the extent that these macro-level factors relate to ﬁrm-level adoptions is unclear. In response, this study examines whether management fashion concepts can aid in understanding if agile adoptions can be characterized as mindful or mindless and transitory or pervasive. In the next section, we outline the methodology employed in this research to address this gap.

Methodology
A common approach adopted in past management fashion studies is to examine the number of instances that a particular technique appears within the practitioner and academic press in order to evaluate its rise and fall in overall popularity (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999; Baskerville & Myers, 2009; Hirschheim et al, 2012). Although valuable, commentators have highlighted the additional insights that can be generated by examining the events occurring within speciﬁc organizations in response to these fashion-setting drivers related to the decisions to adopt, use, or abandon new techniques (Zbaracki, 1998; Benders and van Veen 2001; Clark, 2004). In examining these micro-level scenarios, past research has also recognized the appropriateness of qualitative studies to examine speciﬁc cases of the creation and selection phases of the management fashion process (Abrahamson, 1996; Zbaracki, 1998).

Data collection In order to cultivate this rich viewpoint of management fashion concepts within ﬁrm-level agile adoptions, our study employs a qualitative approach based on 42 interviews with participants involved in systems development projects that include agile techniques. Five case study organizations (names have been disguised at the request

Variance was established in the agile method used (e.g. XP, Scrum), the duration that agile had been in place for, and the company’s industry. Interviewees included executives (e.g. VP of Systems Development, VP of IT, Director of IT), middle managers (e.g. Systems Development Manager, Business Analysis Manager, Manager – Business Systems), and staff (e.g. Developer). Interviewees were selected on the basis of participation on a project that employed at least some agile techniques. We began our interviews with a senior executive and requested interviews with supplementary project team members. The data were collected as part of a broader research program investigating control within systems development processes. Details of the participants and organizations are noted in Table 2, including the industry, number of interviews, agile approach details, and date of agile adoption. LargeMan is a multi-national manufacturing organization based in the United States. They have historically relied on a traditional waterfall development approach, but began to pilot agile techniques in 2009. By 2011, some project teams within their development process were exclusively using agile techniques based on Scrum. Since then, additional teams have adopted Scrum, though other projects continue to rely on a traditional approach. Our data were collected in two stages: in 2009 when agile was initially being piloted and again in 2011 when it was more fully rolled out. Interviewees belonged to project teams using agile within the organization’s Canadian subsidiary. The techniques used by the team included daily stand-up meetings, story cards, and 3-week delivery cycles. The introduction of agile was primarily a grass-roots initiative from a small group of developers and was initiated largely on the basis of a perceived ineffectiveness of the waterfall technique. InfoOrg is a large, U.S.-based organization that provides media and information services to customers around the world. The organization has historically relied on a traditional waterfall development approach, but has transitioned a collection of core projects to an agile approach that follows Scrum. Adopted practices

include stand-up meetings, pair programming, and limited documentation. The initial push to adopt an agile approach was initiated by an IT executive and interest in the approach has been growing steadily within the company. HealthOrg is a large teaching and research hospital based in Canada. Strategically, the organization follows a best-ofbreed approach to software, allowing clinical departments to purchase or build whatever systems they feel contribute most effectively to patient care. Some in-house development and customization is conducted on these clinical systems, as well as work on back-ofﬁce administrative systems and integrating the systems together. HealthOrg has traditionally adhered to a structured, waterfall development approach, but recently began to use agile. The adopted approach is based in Scrum, but includes extensive customizations. InsureCorp is a medium-sized insurance and ﬁnancial services company based in Canada. The organization employs a mix of legacy and modern systems, including both off-the-shelf and custom developed applications. InsureCorp has traditionally followed a structured waterfall approach. In 2005/2006, a consulting ﬁrm was hired to assist the company in adopting agile, but the project was widely viewed as a failure and the company returned exclusively to waterfall shortly afterwards. In 2011, InsureCorp determined that they would make another attempt, but the previous experience has led to an avoidance of the term ‘agile’, because of the negative connotation within the organization. As such, no formal alliance with a speciﬁc agile method (e.g. Scrum, XP) has been established, although elements of these approaches are in place (e.g. sprints, stand-up meetings). Overall, InsureCorp is undertaking a highly cautious agile adoption. They view the approach as being a better way of expediting development, but are still learning about agile and are selecting only the techniques they perceive to be most valuable. CodeCorp is a medium-sized IT services organization that specializes in developing custom software systems, primarily for ﬁnancial services and healthcare clients. They are based in Canada and their systems development teams operate from a single ofﬁce location. The organization has a long history with agile development and adopts an eXtreme

Indicator description Agile is adopted by organizations because it is perceived as a novel technique. For example, agile is adopted because it is viewed as the most cutting-edge, advanced approach to systems development. Agile is adopted based on pronouncements by others that it provides the most efficient means to develop systems. For example, the adoption of agile is influenced by a development manager who reads an article by a prominent author that argues agile is a faster development approach compared to a planbased waterfall approach. Agile is perceived to fulfill the psychological needs of employees (e.g. individuality, novelty, avoidance of anxiety). For example, agile is adopted because it is viewed by developers as enabling them to be more creative and feel that they are contributing to the project deliverables. Agile is perceived to be consistent with industry and organizational characteristics such as economic fluctuations, politics, structure, and culture. For example, agile is adopted because it is viewed as being an appropriate fit for a company’s collaborative culture. Agile is sufficiently ambiguous to allow it to be ceremonially adopted in a manner that diverges from the original intentions of its creators; however, without these elements, the approach has diminished power and longevity. For example, agile is claimed to be adopted, but only the pair programming and story card techniques are employed.

Programming (XP) approach on all projects it undertakes. This includes techniques such as pair programming, story cards, shared code ownership, and self-determining teams. Agile has been in place for more than a decade and is heavily embedded in the day-to-day operations of the company.

Data analysis Structured coding and analysis of the interview data were conducted in order to identify evidence of management fashion characteristics. Each interview transcript was reviewed by the ﬁrst author to identify the existence of the ﬁve fashion indicators noted in Table 1, as they apply to agile development (see Table 3). Where an interviewee comment mapped to one or more of the indicators, it was highlighted and coded using NVivo. A total of 235 segments of text were identiﬁed and coded against the management fashion indicators. In order to verify the validity of the coding, the second author reviewed the complete coding results; all disagreements were discussed and resolved. Following the coding, we ﬁrst examined the individual case studies for evidence of management fashion indicators that were particularly prevalent or notably absent, based on the identiﬁed interview segments. We rereviewed the data within each indicator category and began to generate a preliminary ‘proﬁle’ of each case’s conﬁguration of management fashion indicators (e.g. numerous examples of innovation devolution, but few examples related to the norm of rationality). We considered not only the total quantity of interview segments coded to a particular indicator, but also the consistency among interviewees. Next, we compared the results across cases by looking for patterns within the preliminary proﬁles that we had created for each individual case. This approach helped us

to reﬁne our initial assessment of the data by enabling a comparison of each management fashion indicator across the cases. During this review, we drew on past approaches by Bergeron et al (2004) and Reich & Benbasat (2000) to assign ratings on the extent that each case contained evidence of the fashion indicators. Where the data strongly supported the presence of an indicator (e.g. frequent interviewee references to an indicator, corroboration of perspectives related to an indicator across interviewees, detailed and extensive examples provided in relation to an indicator), we rated the indicator as ‘High’; where some data supported the existence of an indicator (e.g. reference to an indicator in only some interviews, minor inconsistencies of indicator perspectives across interviewees, general indicator descriptions and examples provided), we rated the indicator as ‘Moderate’; where little or no data supported the existence of an indicator (e.g. few interviewee references to an indicator, signiﬁcant inconsistencies in indicator perspectives across interviewees, very limited indicator descriptions and examples provided), we rated the indicator as ‘Low’. It is important to note that the indicator ratings should not be interpreted as a judgment on the value, effectiveness, or importance of an innovation’s adoption; for example, a ‘High’ rating should not be equated with either a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ assessment, but rather that the agile adoption exhibited evidence that was consistent with the presence of one management fashion indicator. We present the results in the next section, followed by a discussion that can aid in distinguishing between the identiﬁed patterns.

Results
A summary of the ratings for each management fashion indicator by case study is listed in Table 4. Two cases contained moderate or high ratings for four of the

indicators, two cases contained moderate or high ratings for three of the indicators, and one case contained high ratings for two of the indicators. These results support the argument that agile development is broadly consistent with at least some elements of a management fashion for each of the ﬁve cases. However, because of the variance in the results, we argue that simply labeling agile as a transitory fashion fails to sufﬁciently differentiate how the organizations we studied adopted and used the approach. In examining the Table 4 data, we ﬁrst considered the rankings within each case that corresponded with relatively extreme viewpoints (i.e. high or low ratings), which could distinguish the company’s adoption and use of agile from the other cases. We then compared these extreme rankings across cases to determine if any simple patterns existed, such as all high or low ratings. As no clear pattern emerged from this approach, we then considered more complex patterns, such as a consistent mix of high and low ratings across the fashion indicators. We also began to consider the role of moderate rankings in discerning patterns among the data. Using an iterative approach, we began to construct possible groupings of cases on the basis of patterns across the ﬁve indicators. Where a possible grouping was identiﬁed (e.g. both HealthOrg and InsureCorp exhibited a High rating for Norms of Progress), we re-examined the qualitative data to verify if evidence of cross-case similarities existed. Where Moderate ratings were assigned, we considered whether the case data were consistent with the data from other cases that received a high/low rating or was distinct and should be grouped separately.

The authors discussed the groupings and made iterative reﬁnements to the categories based on the review of the underlying data until each case was deemed to be grouped with other cases that exhibited similarities across each of the ﬁve fashion indicators. Figure 1 illustrates the approach we adopted. One organization, CodeCorp, was found to demonstrate either high or moderate evidence of the norms of rationality, socio-psychological, and techno-economic indicators, but virtually no evidence of the other categories. In comparison, two organizations, LargeMan and InfoOrg, exhibited somewhat similar moderate/high categories as CodeCorp, but showed more evidence of the norms of progress and innovation devolution characteristics. Finally, HealthOrg and InsureCorp were essentially the opposite to CodeCorp, with high evidence of norms of progress and innovation devolution, but relatively little evidence from the other categories. Based on common patterns of the management fashion indicators that emerged across the cases, we propose three distinct categories of agile development adoption and use (see Table 5). We refer to these categories as the Crusader, the Tailor, and the Dabbler, each of which consists of a distinct conﬁguration of management fashion indicator characteristics. Each of the ﬁve case studies is proposed as an example of the category that it is most consistent with. Similar to the indicator ratings above, we continue to impose no value judgments on the categories, but present them as an identiﬁed pattern of management fashion indicators within the empirical data. Following this, we discuss the link between the fashion indicators, mindfulness/mindlessness, and transitory/pervasive innovations. The ﬁrst category, the Crusader, is characterized by high norms of rationality, socio-psychological forces, and techno-economic forces, but low norms of progress and innovation devolution. We view Crusaders as employing a highly prescriptive adoption of agile techniques, alongside an avoidance of traditional approaches entirely. CodeCorp is viewed as a Crusader in its ‘by-the-book’ adoption of XP and exclusive use of agile techniques. In discussions with staff at CodeCorp, there was broad agreement that agile was a natural ﬁt to the organization’s culture and structure (i.e. socio-psychological and techno-economic forces).

There was also a strong sense that agile was a better, more rational approach compared to traditional methods (i.e. norm of rationality). The following interviewee quotes highlights this view: It’s just a much more productive and effective environment. So basically, software development is very much an art, and the ability to leave the artists alone to work on their art, while at the same time being able to facilitate them to do what they do and protect them from all the other outside forces. I think is a real motivator for them. So, it allows the developers to do what they do best and when they’re in that mode, they’re most productive. (Project Manager) I think that a major point is that the feedback cycle is a lot shorter. Let’s say you are at a stand up and you are discussing what you have been doing over the last two or three days. If you are not going any further then you catch it at that point and you don’t catch it two or three weeks down the line. (Developer) There was little evidence at CodeCorp that suggested either management or staff did not have full conﬁdence in the agile approach. In fact, interviewees highlighted improved morale, fulﬁllment, and creativity within the development staff. In contrast to past management fashion theory views that frame the norm of rationality indicator as relatively superﬁcial, CodeCorp staff appeared to be more consistent and persuasive in their argument that agile actually is a more effective means of developing software and contributes to the best interests of the organization. This uniformity of employee opinion that agile was clearly a better development approach than the alternatives was a key distinguishing

factor of the Crusader category. The following quote explains this perspective: The work that is created is a lot better quality and the overall process ends up being faster, because you’re kept on task because you’re working with other people and you’re also [employing a] two heads are better than one kind of idea. So you end up creating a product that’s better and you end up getting it done faster in the end. (Developer) Crusaders are also characterized by an absence of adoption for adoption’s sake (i.e. norms of progress) or a desire to concurrently adopt other development approaches (i.e. innovation devolution), which was the case at CodeCorp. Employees at the organization tended to have deep technical experience and extensive familiarity with agile techniques, which could account for their strong opinions. The following quote highlights the Crusader view of adopting a ‘pure’ form of agile: Agile has interlocking practices or principles [and] you have to do all of them, right? So, you have to do pair programming, we have to do the testing, we have to do all those pieces in concert. If you try and skip out on one of them, then what ends up happening is [that] you’ve taken out something that’s important … if you start throwing those things out, then you’re in trouble. (Developer) The Tailor category is characterized by a moderate degree of all ﬁve management fashion indicators. Although Tailors adopt many agile techniques, there is an implicit ﬂexibility to adapt some aspects of the approach on a project-by-project basis alongside practices from other development approaches. At LargeMan and InfoOrg, agile was widely adopted, but was used in conjunction

with some elements of a waterfall approach. Our data indicate that management and staff generally agreed with the philosophy and beneﬁts of agile (i.e. norm of rationality), but maintained that the characteristics of the development team, company culture and organizational structure (i.e. socio-psychological forces, techno-economic forces) required some reﬁnements and adjustments to the agile practices. This tended to result in a piecemeal adoption of agile, where select practices became optional for developers. For example, some developers at LargeMan resisted participating in the agile practice of pair programming, where two staff members work together in completing a development task. Management typically permitted pair programming to be conducted either on a voluntary basis or required only a minimum level of adherence to the practice, as the following interviewee quote highlights: So we have put a challenge out to the whole team that everyone needs to at least do one pair programming session through this next sprint and it is a short sprint, only 2 weeks. So everyone agreed; we will see how it goes. (Development Manager, LargeMan) A similar circumstance occurred at InfoOrg, where agile project teams utilized weekly meetings, rather than daily stand-up meetings. This decision was made on the basis that staff didn’t perceive a sufﬁcient beneﬁt to result from the act of meeting on a daily basis. Although staff were aware that this deviated from agile guidelines, they determined that it was a better ﬁt for their project circumstances. The following quote highlights this approach: Not daily stand ups … we usually do more of a weekly thing. Yeah, and that tends to work better for us. I think that we tried doing daily stand up meetings and there just wasn’t much point to it. (Developer, InfoOrg) In addition to the selected adoption of agile practices, perceived misalignments with socio-psychological forces and techno-economic forces also drove the continued use of plan-driven, waterfall approach elements. These factors were most commonly associated with a reluctance to fully depart from a traditional development approach. Although employees appeared to genuinely value the social and technical beneﬁts that agile introduced, they also continued to value elements of their previous development approach. The following quotes provide examples from the LargeMan and InfoOrg case studies: I guess the major deviation that I am seeing right now is that within a sprint we are not saying that the deﬁnition of ‘done’ is production-ready code. It is code that is completed, but we still run a QA cycle in tandem with every development cycle … I see that as a deviation from pure Scrum. (Development Lead, LargeMan) We had a project that we ran sort of [a] half-and-half approach. The base of the project was based on waterfall, because there were some grey areas in the technology program. The technology team basically was gathering every morning … in the Scrum discussing what they wanted to do that day and what are their problems …

so it was sort of a mixture of both [approaches]. (Developer, InfoOrg) The third category that emerged from our analysis is the Dabbler, which is characterized by low norms of rationality, socio-psychological forces, and techno-economic forces, but high norms of progress and innovation devolution. Dabblers typically adopt and use agile in a largely ceremonial way that employs a few agile techniques, but remains primarily rooted in a plan-driven development approach. Both InsureCorp and HealthOrg are seen to belong to this category. Although some employee and management support for agile existed in both organizations, the push to adopt the approach appears to be driven by management’s desire to be perceived as adopting an innovative tactic to address challenges with the current development approach (i.e. norms of progress). Few justiﬁcations were made by interviewees about how agile was viewed as being a good ﬁt for the organization or staff; rather, agile was most commonly discussed in general terms as being new and better, such as with the following quote: Everyone is willing and interested in how can we do things better because we are ﬁnding that we need to get better. It is an important capability for our organization. There is a lot of change out there. (Development Manager, InsureCorp) There was also more open opposition to the agile approach than there was in the Crusader or Tailor categories, which is indicative of misalignment between agile and the corresponding socio-psychological/technoeconomic forces. At both InsureCorp and HealthOrg, there was a degree of uncertainty about what agile actually represented and a lack of clarity about whether the approach ﬁt with the culture and structure of the organization. In contrast to employees within a Crusader company, Dabbler employees tended to have less development experience and acted as technology generalists rather than experts in a particular area. This unfamiliarity with agile and lack of opinion on how it may help is consistent with a much shorter-term, transitional view of agile, as the following quotes highlight: Given how small we are, I would not be surprised if, as we learned a little bit more about agile, that we either make a decision to stick with it or drop it. (IT Director, HealthOrg) I think that agile is useful in some situations and not so useful in others and then there are other sorts of hybrid approaches that we should consider as well. But I don’t think that there is any universal answer and one-size-ﬁtsall sort of SDLC methodology. (Development Manager, InsureCorp) Dabblers were distinct from Tailors in their degree of innovation devolution. Rather than assembling a hybrid development approach that merged the use of agile with some plan-driven practices, Dabblers had much more difﬁculty leaving their plan-driven traditions behind. This was often the case because many agile techniques

fundamentally diverged from the tenets of traditional development approaches (e.g. requirements, documentation, etc.) and following the agile guidance was viewed by employees as being inconsistent with commonly accepted conventions. Interviewees suggested that developers resisted agile techniques they viewed as being at odds with established practices: Talking to my PM who is actually leading this process, the staff are holding on to the fact that they need requirements and they still are falling back on the fact that they need lots of documentation. (Project Management Director, InsureCorp) So in order for us to implement something, we still have to go through our management process of getting it approved and a go-live and a sign off by the directors and we have to prove that we have tested and that it has been accepted. (Development Manager, HealthOrg) This section has presented three proposed categories of agile adoption and use that emerged from our analysis of management fashion indicators. Based on our collected data, we have assigned each of the ﬁve participating companies to the category its operations are most consistent with. Next, we discuss these ﬁndings in the context of the agile, management fashion, and mindfulness literature.

Discussion
As noted above, the organizations grouped as Crusaders, Tailors, or Dabblers were inﬂuenced differently by the management fashion indicators. Whereas Crusaders and Tailors were inﬂuenced mostly by norms of rationality, socio-psychological forces, and techno-economic forces, Dabblers were inﬂuenced most strongly by characteristics of fashions related to the norm of progress and innovation devolution. Based on these patterns, this section discusses how our data support insights into how management fashion concepts aid in better understanding the mindful (or mindless) and more permanent (or transitory) adoption of agile. Drawing on the mindfulness and mindlessness characteristics identiﬁed in past research related to general innovations (Swanson & Ramiller, 2004; Butler & Gray, 2006), as well as agile (Matook & Kautz, 2008; McAvoy et al, 2013), we re-reviewed the three categories and the associated empirical data. In examining the patterns within these categories, distinct perspectives were uncovered relating to mindful vs mindless agile adoption: both Crusaders and Tailors were found to share characteristics that exhibit mindfulness (albeit in different ways), while Dabblers exhibited characteristics most commonly (though not exclusively) associated with mindlessness. However, we noted that exceptions exist that could lead Crusaders to exhibit mindlessness and Dabblers to be mindful. For example, CodeCorp (a Crusader) was highly reluctant to simplify practices and paid close attention to methodological details, two characteristics commonly attributed to mindfulness (Swanson & Ramiller, 2004). They were adamant in their refusal to adapt or alter their pure agile

approach, which they interpreted as an ‘all or nothing’ proposition; this is consistent with minimal innovation devolution from a fashion perspective. CodeCorp also exhibited the mindfulness trait of deference to expertise and the avoidance of formal structure (Swanson & Ramiller, 2004) through their ﬂat organizational structure and shared roles on project teams, which corresponds to elements of socio-emotional and techno-economic indicators. Although the approach of Crusaders, then, can be viewed as being largely consistent with the concept of mindfulness, we can also identify a potential weakness for this type of fashion adopter. Where adopters avoid making changes in order to maintain a fashionable innovation’s complete value, it would be seen as being consistent with past views of mindfulness that promote a reluctance to simplify and a commitment to resilience (Swanson & Ramiller, 2004; McAvoy et al, 2013). However, in cases where the innovation is (or becomes) a poor ﬁt with the organization’s characteristics (i.e. socio-emotional and techno-economic forces), Crusaders may stubbornly avoid adaptation (i.e. innovation devolution), even in circumstances where the technique is failing. This inattention to the speciﬁcs suggests a mindless rather than a mindful adoption. Tailors such as InfoOrg and LargeMan exhibited the mindfulness characteristics of resiliency and alertness to failure (Swanson & Ramiller, 2004). Although they were willing to take risks by moving away from plan-driven approaches in favor of an agile approach, Tailors were continually reﬁning and evaluating the effectiveness of agile. Although agile did not work perfectly every time, customizations were made to improve and adapt the approach going forward. These customizations can be viewed as a moderate degree of innovation devolution, as a completely pure agile approach was not being employed. However, these modiﬁcations were undertaken on the basis that the adapted version of agile was perceived as a better ﬁt for the organization (i.e. techno-economic forces) and its staff (i.e. socio-psychological forces). Indeed, there was little evidence that agile was in jeopardy of being abandoned at Tailor organizations in the short term. We found Tailors to exhibit the most mindfulness characteristics, alongside little evidence of mindlessness. In contrast to Crusaders who maintained a ‘pure’ agile approach, Tailors appeared to demonstrate a greater awareness of their own organizational circumstances, making the adjustments required by the methodology to ﬁt their particular situation. A potential drawback of Tailors from a mindfulness perspective could result from a circumstance that awareness of organizational circumstances results in adjustments of an innovation that extend beyond tailoring to deteriorate into innovation devolution. For example, where the extent of adjustments made to a technique substantively changes its spirit from the original intent, it may no longer contain the same degree of value (Zbaracki, 1998; Benders & van Veen, 2001), which may limit the organizational beneﬁts received. In contrast, Dabblers exhibited characteristics more consistent with mindlessness, often seeming to follow the promises of success stories that praise agile as the latest and

greatest trend, which is consistent with the norm of progress fashion indicator. They were generally anxious to simplify the agile approach wherever possible (e.g. weekly, rather than daily meetings), paid minimal attention to the nuances of the approach (e.g. dismissal of pair programming as a valuable practice), and appeared to have little invested in the long term success of agile (e.g. minimal staff training), which is consistent with a high degree of innovation devolution. Despite the limitations that this type of adoption and use has on the ability to deliver strong organizational beneﬁts, Dabbling may still represent a viable choice for organizations since they can accrue the political and reputational beneﬁts that prior research suggests can come from fashions (Wang, 2010). Even though Dabblers may not generate the operational gains anticipated by Crusaders or Tailors, the adoption of agile could still signal to stakeholders (e.g. executives, customers) that the systems development process is embracing modern advances. However, in contrast to Crusaders and Tailors that exhibited longer-term plans for agile, Dabblers appear to be focused on short-term gains, without investing the time and money to fully appropriate the innovation. Although some organizations are likely to be mindlessly jumping from one fashion to the next without considering the organizational drivers and drawbacks, it is possible that a mindful Dabbler may gain shortterm beneﬁts at a minimal cost. Future research could examine if, at the point that agile begins to wane in terms of prestige and perceived value, a mindful Dabbler could adopt a new innovation that renewed the political and reputational advantages that fashions provide. One possible explanation for the Dabbler category is that some organizations adopting agile may need to undergo an initial period of learning while they transition away from traditional development techniques. Where this transition is able to occur, agile development may become further embedded and the organization could transition into the Crusader or Tailor category. In other cases, the approach may be abandoned in favor of a newly emerging fashion. It is unclear which path our two Dabblers may take; agile is a relatively new technique at HealthOrg, while InsureCorp has already adopted, abandoned, and re-adopted the approach. Although the cross-sectional nature of our data limits the extent that we can identify changing adoption and use patterns over time, future studies that employ a longitudinal approach could uncover important insights that build on our initial observations. The Dabbler category is most consistent with the latency-popularity-decline stage model that management fashions are largely seen to follow (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999; Carson et al, 1999). When it appears that the anticipated beneﬁts promised by agile are waning, the necessity for alternatives or counter-fashions will increase (Kieser, 1997). Because of the conceptual ambiguity and ﬂexibility inherent in agile, particularly for Tailors and Dabblers, our results suggest that it may provide opportunities for organizations to adapt the innovation for their particular needs, which could diminish the demand for

counter-fashions. However, it also allows companies the ﬂexibility to only ceremonially adopt agile, without adopting its core philosophy or many of its techniques. If, for example, more organizations adopt agile as Dabblers and the subsequent performance results are below expectations, it may provide an opportunity for the gurus, consultants, and academics to seek out and propose a new, alternative development approach. This view is compatible with Benders and van Veen’s (2001) suggestion that fashions may also decline in popularity as a result of such extensive adoption that fashion followers can no longer distinguish themselves from others. If the rise of agile continues to grow, it may be viewed as less distinctive and politically valuable for both mindless and mindful Dabblers, who could abandon it for more novel fashions. Following the view that fashions represent transitory beliefs that are iteratively adopted based on the dissemination of management knowledge (Abrahamson, 1991; Abrahamson, 1996), the characteristics of the Dabbler type appears to ﬁt this view most effectively. Both InsureCorp and HealthOrg had distinctly short-term views of agile and exhibited a high degree of innovation devolution and attraction to agile as an embodiment of ‘progress’. In contrast, the Crusader and Tailor appeared less consistent with the perception of agile as a passing fashion, where the adoption of agile was made on the basis of more mindful, reasoned arguments that considered longer-term use of the development approach. Because of this longer-term view of agile at CodeCorp, LargeMan, and InfoOrg, it would suggest that agile is increasingly viewed as an approach that has a degree of pervasiveness. Carson et al (1999) suggest that the progression of a fashion into established collective wisdom occurs when a technique’s beneﬁts outweigh the costs in the short and long term, implementation is not more difﬁcult than expected, the technique improves the organization’s status, and there is institutional support for the technique. Based on the empirical evidence, it appears that these requirements are largely consistent with Crusaders and Tailors, though not with Dabblers. Rather, our results challenge the argument made by Carson et al (1999) by suggesting that in addition to the macro-level characteristics of a fashion, a management technique’s ability to become pervasive within an organization is also shaped by the extent that fashion indicators have inﬂuenced the adoption at the ﬁrm level. Although a growing body of research supports the view that the ﬂexibility of hybrid agile-waterfall approaches employed by Tailors are a viable alternative to an unmodiﬁed, agile-only approach (Vinekar et al, 2006; Port & Bui, 2009; West & Grant, 2010), it highlights the relatively extreme views of Crusaders. In contrast to the anticipated depletion of performance that the management fashion literature would suggest when moving away from a ‘pure’ form of agile (i.e. a devolution of the innovation), systems development research suggests that the Tailor may be no worse off than the Crusader and in some cases it may even be preferable (Fitzgerald et al, 2006; Cao et al, 2009). In relating this observation to the role of industry, our

lone Crusader (CodeCorp), specializes in software development, while the Tailors (InfoOrg, LargeMan) and Dabblers (InsureCorp, HealthOrg) represent the media, manufacturing, insurance, and healthcare industries. In addition to suggesting that Crusaders may be less common compared to Tailors and Dabblers, it also highlights the characteristics that may distinguish Crusaders, such as in-house development expertise, IT thought leadership, and a desire to adopt innovative development practices. Although these characteristics could well exist at companies within a range of industries, it may suggest that Crusaders are more prominent in technology-driven, software-centric industries. In the context of the three categories outlined above, it is possible that mindfulness could be enhanced in circumstances where the choice of agile adoption most closely ﬁt the organizational context. We see this as most applicable to Crusaders, who fully adopt a pure agile approach. Future studies could evaluate if mindful adoptions are consistent with an organization pursuing a Crusader approach when their circumstances are consistent with Boehm & Turner’s (2003) ideal agile factors (e.g. small teams, turbulent environment). Alternatively, a Crusader’s adoption of agile in circumstances consistent with plan-driven factors (e.g. large teams, stable environment) may be indicative of a mindless approach, due to the inﬂexibility that Crusaders employ in implementing the development approach. By considering the insights noted above that are drawn from our analysis, a series of more general, theory-focused insights can be extracted. First, our results suggest that a variety of paths can lead to mindful and mindless adoption of innovations. This indicates that the transitory and partial vs more permanent and holistic adoption of a new management practice does not equate directly to the mindless vs mindful distinction. As a result, managers can beneﬁt by becoming increasingly aware of the pitfalls, as well as the opportunities, associated with how they adopt and use new innovations. This awareness can help to guide decisions related to the time, money, and training that should be allocated towards a new trend vs an existing approach. Second, the nature of an organization’s adoption and use of a management technique is directly linked to the fundamental decisions that will guide the innovation towards increased beneﬁts or declining value. Where an organization falls within the Dabbler category, managers should seek to avoid blindly following each new trend, but instead seek out new innovations that can iteratively enhance the political and reputational beneﬁts of the latest fashion. In contrast, Crusaders and Tailors should aim to exhibit mindful characteristics by dedicating resources towards the reﬁnement and institutionalization of management techniques for the mid to long term. However, Crusaders should be particularly careful to avoid mindlessly pursuing innovations where organizational circumstances may indicate that a hybrid, Tailor-style approach may be more suitable for its circumstances.

Conclusions
The objective of this study was to examine how management fashion concepts aid in better understanding how organizations mindfully (or mindlessly) adopt an agile development approach. Although mindfulness in adopting agile has been considered in prior research, we sought to understand the practical links to management fashions at the ﬁrm level. Drawing on 42 interviews across ﬁve case studies, we examined the extent that ﬁve management fashion indicators were present: norms of progress, norms of rationality, socio-psychological forces, techno-economic forces, and innovation devolution. Based on patterns emerging from the management fashion indicators in each case study, we identiﬁed three categories of agile adoption and use: Crusaders, who exclusively employ agile in a pure form; Tailors, who customize agile to ﬁt their speciﬁc circumstances, while concurrently employing traditional techniques; and Dabblers who employ a few ceremonial agile techniques on top of a fundamentally traditional development approach. We consider those organizations falling into the Dabbler category as being more likely to adopt agile as a short-term, transitory approach before moving on to the next development trend that emerges. In contrast, our ﬁndings suggest that organizations within the Crusader and Tailor categories are more likely to maintain agile development beyond the short term, with the development approach becoming an increasingly pervasive organizational practice.

Limitations and future research As with any study, our work has a number of limitations and opportunities for future research. First, the cross-sectional data used in our study limits the breadth of understanding we have about how management fashions change over time. We recognize the beneﬁts that could be gained by conducting longitudinal research to examine the extent that an organization may evolve in its adoption and use of a management technique, perhaps even transitioning from one category to another (e.g. Dabbler to Tailor). This line of inquiry could also be useful in companies that have adopted, abandoned, and then re-adopted an agile approach, like at InsureCorp. Our research is also limited by the ﬁve management fashion indicators that formed the basis for our analysis, as there may be additional indicators or unique patterns that could further enhance our understanding of the mindful adoption and use of innovations. For example, although we noted the three distinct patterns of management fashion indicators listed in Table 5, it is possible that additional conﬁgurations of these indicators could exist in other organizations. To this end, although we argue that concepts from management fashion theory contribute to developing our understanding of how agile is adopted and used, it is one of many available perspectives. Future research could consider alternative theoretical approaches that complement the insights provided by fashions, including self-efﬁcacy theory, structuration theory, and resource dependency theory. Finally, although we

attempted to select a range of cases in order to get a varied view of agile adoption and use, extending the sample of participants would be beneﬁcial. This could include a wider range of agile types (e.g. three of ﬁve cases used Scrum, while only one used XP), as well as further investigation on the possible links between industry and Crusader/Tailor/Dabbler categorization (e.g. frequency of Crusaders in the software industry vs the manufacturing industry). This could further reﬁne our model and identify new patterns that exist in relation to our agile adoption and use categorizations.

The insights from this study contribute to the growing research on agile development by applying a management fashion theory lens that can aid in better understanding how agile is adopted and used. Our ﬁndings suggest that although some agile adoptions exhibit characteristics of mindlessness and are consistent with passing fashions, others exhibit evidence of a mindful, pervasive role for agile development in organizations. Our proposed categories highlight the characteristics that distinguish between agile adoptions, while shedding light on the paths that can lead to mindful and mindless innovations.
