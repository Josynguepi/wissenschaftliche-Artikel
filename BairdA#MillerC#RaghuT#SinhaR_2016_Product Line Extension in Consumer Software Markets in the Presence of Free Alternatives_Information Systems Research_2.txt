ypercompetitive consumer software markets pit incumbents against free alternatives and pirates. Although the extant literature has studied ﬁrm level strategic responses to consumer heterogeneity and piracy, there is a lack of understanding of consumer reactions to digital goods choice sets that include ﬁrm product extensions such as the introduction of premium or free alternatives. With context-dependent preferences as the theoretical basis, this study systematically examines the impact of piracy controls and product line extensions on welfare in a consumer software market context (i.e., willingness to pay (WTP) and changes in consumer and producer surplus). In two controlled experiments using double-bound-dichotomous-choice WTP elicitation, we investigate how piracy controls and product line extensions impact two different platforms of the same software (PC Adobe applications and mobile Adobe applications) in terms of propensity to pirate and WTP. We show that introducing a premium or free vertical extension has different impacts on consumers’ WTP for the focal product depending on whether it is a low-cost or high-cost market even when controlling for individual differences, such as price fairness perceptions, product feature value, brand perceptions, etc. By contrast, piracy controls reduce piracy rates but have a limited impact on consumer WTP for the focal product in both contexts. By calculating the overall welfare of the market, we show that there is alignment in consumer and producer interests at current and estimated optimal price levels in both high-cost and low-cost markets. However, the introduction of a free product extension leads to a higher surplus in the high-cost market, whereas the introduction of the premium product extension leads to a higher surplus in the low-cost market.

Introduction

Incumbents in digital consumer markets often ﬁnd their offerings competing with pirated and free alternatives. For instance, a recent Business Software Alliance (BSA) report found that over 50% of personal computer users around the world admit to pirating software, which contributed to an estimated $63 billion shadow market for software products (BSA 2011). Furthermore, the emergence of free alternatives in virtually all consumer software categories creates signiﬁcant new challenges for incumbents (Bryce et al. 2011). For example, Microsoft Ofﬁce faces this form of competition from OpenOfﬁce, Libre Ofﬁce, NeoOfﬁce, and Google Docs, all of which are free to consumers. Adobe Photoshop Elements, already a highly pirated consumer
282

software (Muchmore 2012), also competes against free alternatives such as GIMP, Pixlr.com, and others. As a result of these pirated and free marketplace alternatives, incumbents have been forced to consider piracy control and product line extension strategies to compete. Piracy controls—such as license restrictions and product activation keys—are intended to prevent consumers from illegally appropriating the software product. Product line extensions, on the other hand, involve the offering of product versions at different price/quality tiers that are intended to appeal to distinct consumer segments with varying needs and levels of willingness to pay (WTP). Thus, ﬁrms attempt to maximize their market penetration and minimize piracy using a combination of piracy controls and vertical product extensions.

283 individual difference variables, the key result in our research is the differential impact of vertical extension type on consumers’ WTP in high-cost and low-cost markets. When a premium product line extension is introduced in a high-cost software market, consumers’ WTP for the focal software is lower and consumers’ propensity to pirate is higher than when a free product extension is introduced. This ﬁnding is reversed in low-cost markets. A premium product extension in the mobile market increases consumers’ WTP for the focal software and lowers propensity to pirate when compared to a free product extension. Additionally, we ﬁnd that piracy controls are effective in reducing consumers’ propensity to pirate in both high-cost and low-cost markets. However, piracy controls have a limited impact on WTP for the focal product. Finally, using a demand analysis, we show that in both markets, consumer and producer interests are aligned. In a high-cost market, consumer and producer surplus are highest when piracy controls are used and a free product extension is introduced. In the low-cost market, consumer and producer surplus are highest when no piracy control is used and a premium product extension is introduced. Overall, our research provides important managerial recommendations for product line extensions and piracy controls in different market conditions. In what follows, we provide the theoretical background for our hypotheses, describe our empirical work, and provide detailed analyses and results. Finally, we end with a discussion of our ﬁndings in comparison to prior theorizing and offer concluding remarks.

Importantly, a major gap in the extant literature is the paucity of research that uses the consumer as the unit of analysis to examine theoretical predictions with regard to product extensions—or the introduction of a new product that is a modiﬁcation or reformulation of an existing product (Wilson and Norton 1989)—in competitive settings. Consumer reaction in this context can act as a distinct and signiﬁcant contributor to ﬁrm strategies and outcomes, particularly for ﬁrms competing in digital markets. Although some research has focused on consumers and their reactions to piracy controls in the face of independent free alternatives (i.e., Raghu et al. 2009, Sinha and Mandel 2008), researchers have not investigated how vertical product extension and piracy control strategies should be used in tandem. Importantly, previous research has restricted its focus to WTP measures (Raghu et al. 2009, Sinha and Mandel 2008) and although WTP is an important construct in the consumer context, it does not fully measure the overall demand impacts of piracy on the incumbent. Shifts in consumer segments because of the presence of alternatives can impact producer surplus even when the average WTP of the demand distribution is unaffected. In this research, we contribute to the existing literature by investigating how consumer reactions to product line extensions and piracy control strategies impact not only consumers’ piracy intentions and WTP valuations but also producer and consumer surplus in digital goods markets. Using context-dependent preferences as the theoretical framework (Tversky and Simonson 1993), we develop insights into consumer valuation of a focal product as ﬁrms introduce vertical product extensions— in the form of premium or free alternatives—with high or low levels of piracy control. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst research to take into account the heterogeneity of different forms of software markets. As such, we consider two hedonic software consumption contexts where Adobe Photoshop Elements (representative of the high-cost traditional PC market) and Adobe Photoshop Touch (representative of the low-cost emergent mobile market) are the focal digital products. We utilize two controlled experiments to measure consumers’ WTP and piracy intentions associated with these focal products in a contingent valuation framework (Hanemann 1984, 1994). Subsequently, we also estimate demand curves under different experimental conditions to compute consumer, producer, and overall surplus. The ﬁndings from our controlled experimental settings and analyses contribute to the existing literature by providing insights into the notion that vertical extensions of a product line can (a) impact consumers WTP valuations differently depending on the market type, and (b) be an effective approach to combating piracy in consumer software markets.

Background and Hypotheses

With the ﬁrm as the focus of analysis, prior research has suggested a variety of strategies for alleviating competitive challenges and piracy in software markets. For instance, incumbent ﬁrms can manage piracy through prevention controls (Banerjee 2003) such as the imposition of license key and activation requirements during or after installation of the software. These preventive controls are successful because they increase the end-user cost of pirating (Gopal and Sanders 1997). However, piracy control mechanisms often burden both pirates and legitimate users alike. Although this approach can be effective for reducing piracy, the associated burden or inconvenience may also induce consumers to react negatively to piracy control measures when the measures clash with existing social norms (Depoorter et al. 2005). Another approach to managing piracy—which many powerful incumbents have taken—is to reduce the prices of existing products in consumer markets (Liebowitz and Margolis 1999, Nascimento and Vanhonacker 1988). However, because of consumers’ affective reaction to a zero price point (Shampanier

284 et al. 2007) lowering the prices of existing offerings may not be enough to compete against free alternatives. As a result, instead of changing the prices of current product offerings, incumbents could pursue product line extensions to broaden their market reach and more effectively compete against free and pirated alternatives (Sun et al. 2004). With an existing product portfolio, a product line extension is an extremely attractive option to incumbents in software markets because a ﬁrm can offer multiple versions with almost negligible impacts on product development costs. As a viable strategy, software versioning—through the use of vertical product line extensions—is broadly supported as a means of combating piracy (Chellappa and Shivendu 2005, Wu and Chen 2008). For instance, consumers may recalibrate their brand and product perceptions when presented with product line extensions (Loken and John 1993, Heath et al. 2011) leading to changes in WTP valuations and piracy intentions of the focal product. However, how consumer reactions to piracy controls and product line extensions (1) impact consumers’ WTP valuations and piracy intentions of a focal product as well as (2) impact consumer and producer surplus in the marketplace is, as yet, an unanswered question. We ﬁll this gap in the research because there is good reason to believe that beyond affecting piracy rates, the introduction of vertical extensions should also impact the WTP of a focal product (Heath et al. 2011). Thus, ﬁrms need to be cognizant of how the expansion of their product lineup will not only impact piracy rates but also consumers’ WTP valuations of the incumbent ﬁrm’s focal product. Additionally, we show how these two variables impact the consumer and producer surplus in the marketplace. 2.1. Product Line Extensions We draw on context-dependent preferences (Tversky and Simonson 1993) as the theoretical basis for understanding the impact of vertical product extensions

on the WTP valuations, piracy intentions, and the overall market welfare for a focal product. For instance, classical choice theory stipulates that preference among options is independent of the other options in the set. By contrast, context-dependent choice theory states that consumers’ preferences are speciﬁcally inﬂuenced by the contextual nature of the choice task—the focus of this research—and also by their experiences and beliefs (Payne et al. 1992), which we control for in this research. We make use of this theory because it represents the reality that consumers face when they are considering a variety of options within a market. For instance, when making a purchase decision, consumers not only consider the characteristics of the focal product but also consider the characteristics of other available alternatives, including versions of other products offered by the same producer. Context-dependent preference theory suggests that consumer preferences will change depending on several factors that exist in the market. These factors can include the relative price of products, the number of offerings in a consideration set, and even how the offerings in a market are introduced (i.e., the introduction of a free or premium vertical product extension). If a consumer’s preference for a focal product can be inﬂuenced by how the producer enters the market, then the way in which an incumbent changes their product lineup should also impact consumers’ evaluations of the focal product even if the ﬁnal product lineup ends up identical (despite differences in introduction strategy); see Figure 1. We develop our main research hypotheses with the underlying assumption that context-dependent variables—such as the introduction of vertical product extensions—impact consumers’ valuations of a focal product; see Figure 2. When presented with alternatives for a product, consumer cognitive processing focuses on the value offered by the product’s attributes. Higher perceived quality association, variety, and innovativeness are the key attributes that drive consumer valuation

(Heath et al. 2011). These effects will be salient in software markets since software products are often reviewed and evaluated through feature set comparisons and performance benchmarking. A higher level of capability or a larger set of features improve focal product valuations because consumers are likely to associate the product and the ﬁrm with higher quality (Kirmani et al. 1999, Heath et al. 2011, Zeithaml 1988). When a software producer offers higher capability versions of a product, it can signal the superior technical capabilities of the producer and a path to upgrade the focal product in the near future. On the other hand, when incumbents offer product line extensions at the lower end to match low or zero price competitors, consumers may lower the performance expectations of the focal product (Heath et al. 2011) but perceive it as more accessible. Although quality associations, variety, and innovativeness are compelling reasons for a consumer to make a purchase, it is unclear if their effects will hold when the comparison set involves a free alternative, such as a zero price version of the focal product. This is particularly important considering that many software developers are introducing free versions of their software in the marketplace (Reid 2015). Context dependent preferences suggest that quality assumptions (associated with premium products) and the zero price effect (associated with free products) will impact how consumers view a focal product—both piracy intentions and WTP valuations—within the same consideration set.

With regard to a free vertical extension within the framework of context-dependent preferences theory, it can be shown that consumers evaluate a zero price differently from nonzero prices. Shampanier et al. (2007) develop a formal theoretical argument to show the higher valuations of zero price products. Furthermore, they explore several psychological explanations for why consumers regard zero as a special price and conclude that affective evaluation may be one plausible cause. That is, when a product is offered at a zero price it evokes greater positive affect in consumers compared to a nonzero price. For a premium vertical extension, a similar argument can be made that consumers’ associate a product with more features and a higher price with quality (Zeithaml 1988). As such, when a premium product with additional features is introduced as a vertical extension, consumers’ quality assumptions should also pass to the focal product (Hertzendorf 1993). Thus, there are strong theoretical reasons to conclude that the introduction of a free vertical extension and/or a premium vertical extension will beneﬁt the WTP valuations associated with a focal product. However, extant research has not previously investigated how a vertical extension will impact WTP valuations and piracy intentions as well as producer and consumer surpluses associated with these ﬁrm actions. As a result, it remains unclear when the quality associations due to a premium vertical extension or the positive affect from a free vertical extension—both of which are common strategies to expand product lines (see

286 Randall et al. 1998, Reid 2015)—will impact consumers’ WTP valuations of a focal product. We believe that the type of market—low cost or high cost—will determine which vertical extension will most beneﬁt the focal product. In a high-cost market—such as with the traditional PC software platform where the products are featurerich—consumers will already have high-quality expectations (Zeithaml 1988), which should negate the impact of the quality associations related to the premium vertical extension. Instead, in the high-cost market, offering a free alternative with limited features may more likely evoke positive affect. As such, we believe that the positive affect from a zero price vertical extension should positively impact consumers’ WTP valuations of a focal product (Erat and Bhaskaran 2012, Shampanier et al. 2007). Formally stated, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 1A (Free Vertical Extension WTP). In a high-cost market, consumers’ WTP valuations of the focal product will be higher for a free vertical product line extension than for a premium vertical product line extension. Conversely, we suggest that in a low-cost market—or mobile platform—the zero price affective evaluation should not have an impact on the valuation of the focal product. Since the barrier to entry to the focal product is already low, the introduction of a free vertical extension should have a muted impact on the focal product’s WTP valuations. Instead, we anticipate that in the low-cost market, consumers’ WTP valuations of a focal product will be more positively impacted by a premium vertical product extension (Hertzendorf 1993). When a premium product is introduced in the low-cost market, quality associations from the premium, feature-rich product (Zeithaml 1988) should increase the WTP valuations associated with the focal product. Formally stated, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 1B (Premium Vertical Extension WTP). In a low-cost market, consumers’ WTP valuations of the focal product will be higher for a premium vertical product line extension than for a free vertical product line extension. Despite the differences between WTP evaluations that we suggest are impacted by market type, we do not believe there is a theoretical argument for ﬁnding differences in piracy rates as a function of market type. Rather, in both a high-cost and low-cost market the introduction of a free vertical extension should lead to lower piracy rates of the focal product because the existence of a free vertical extension gives consumers— who may pirate because they are not willing to pay any money for the software—legitimate access to the software, albeit at a reduced feature level, for free (Sinha and Mandel 2008, Raghu et al. 2009). In other words, the incremental utility gained from pirating is lower when a free alternative is available. The efforts

Information Systems Research 27(2), pp. 282–301, © 2016 INFORMS

and costs of pirating may no longer make pirating an attractive option for many consumers. Formally stated, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 2 (Vertical Extensions and Piracy Intentions). In both low-cost and high-cost markets, consumers’ piracy intentions will be higher for a premium vertical product line extension than for a free vertical product line extension. 2.2. Piracy Controls Piracy controls are intended to force or encourage consumers to purchase legitimate software copies. The predominant approach to piracy control at the individual level is preventive control (i.e., the use of license, activation keys, and/or registration). Many consumer software products require online registration and may even track machine identiﬁcation information to dissuade piracy. Piracy controls therefore increase the search and acquisition costs of illegitimate software copies (Conner and Rumelt 1991, Gopal and Sanders 1997). In addition, piracy controls highlight the software producer’s rights to the product and force potential pirates to reconsider the moral and ethical considerations of illegal copying (Raghu et al. 2009). Overall, even though it imposes costs on legitimate users, piracy controls are considered highly effective for software products. Thus, the effect of increased acquisition costs for pirated goods on piracy rates should remain in the same direction for both high-cost and low-cost markets. Formally stated, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 3 (Piracy Controls and Piracy Intentions). In both low-cost and high-cost markets, piracy controls will result in lower consumer propensity to pirate the focal product when compared to no piracy controls. Although the presence of piracy controls should reduce the piracy rate because they impose additional costs on the pirate to circumvent the controls, it is less likely that piracy controls affect consumer WTP. However, the presence of a free alternative, in addition to providing potential pirates free access, may also sensitize legitimate consumers against burdensome registration, usage, and installation restrictions. Given that a free alternative can be installed on an unlimited number of computers (or allow online use), consumers may view licensing restrictions to be intrusive. For example, in the context of digital music piracy, user incentives—through investments in enhancing product quality—have been shown to be more effective than piracy controls (Sinha and Mandel 2008). As such, any impact on consumer WTP valuation can only be through elevated inconvenience expectations associated with product use (e.g., requirements of registration/ dealing with multiple devices). Thus, we anticipate a negative impact of piracy controls on WTP valuations. Formally stated, we hypothesize the following:

287 introduce either a premium product line extension (Adobe CS6, retail $149) or a free extension (Adobe Express, free online). In Study 2, we test our theory in the mobile software market (representative of a lowcost market) by making use of Adobe Photoshop Touch (retail $4.99) as our focal product. For our treatment, we introduce either a premium product line extension (Adobe Photoshop Touch Exp, retail $9.99) or a free product line extension (Adobe Photoshop Express, free online). 3.1. Individual Difference Covariates In addition to ﬁrm determined contexts that inﬂuence preferences as outlined in our four hypotheses, we also sought to control for individual differences in consumers’ beliefs and experiences (Payne et al. 1992) that are inherent in context dependent preferences. Although many have not been previously addressed in the information systems (IS) literature, the individual difference variables mentioned in §7 are important because there are theoretical reasons for why they should have a direct impact on consumers’ WTP valuations and/or piracy intentions. By controlling for these variables we eliminate them as alternative explanations for the context-dependent effects in the two different market types (low cost and high cost). Although most of the covariates are included in both the piracy control and WTP equations, consumers’ propensity to share is restricted to the piracy control equation and performance expectations is restricted to the WTP equation for theoretical reasons and empirical identiﬁcation purposes (we require at least one variable to distinguish the two equations). We measured participants’ “propensity to share” because the decision to pirate software relies on another consumer’s decision to share the software that they have purchased legally. Raghu et al. (2009) measured consumers’ propensity to share software when investigating WTP valuations in the presence of open source software and free software. We included this covariate in this analysis because we expect consumers’ propensity to share to impact consumers’ decision to pirate the software. Additionally, we measured consumers’ “performance expectations” of the software because their perceptions of quality should impact their overall perception of the value of a product (Zeithaml 1988). As a result, we anticipate that quality expectations, such as how well the product is expected to perform, will also play a role in consumers’ WTP valuations. We also measured “price fairness” because it is well known that notions of fairness and legitimacy inﬂuence the psychological evaluation of goods (Ajzen et al. 2000, Campbell 2007) and if consumers perceive a price to be unfair, they may decide to punish the ﬁrm by either not buying (and pirating the software) or switching to a competing product. As a result, price fairness is likely

Hypothesis 4 (Piracy Controls and WTP). In both low-cost and high-cost markets, piracy controls will result in lower consumer WTP valuations of the focal product when compared to no piracy controls.

Overview of Studies

In this research, we examine how the introduction of a free or premium vertical extension and piracy controls impact consumers’ WTP valuations of a focal product and consumer/producer surplus. We chose Adobe Photoshop products for this research for four primary reasons. First, our focus is to examine the impact of product line extensions in consumer markets. Most software products are targeted at both professional and consumer audiences. For example, Microsoft Ofﬁce is used by both consumers and businesses. As such, consumer decisions to purchase Microsoft Ofﬁce may be driven by their use in the business environment. Adobe Photoshop products present a context where purchase decisions in the nonprofessional consumer market are predominantly driven by hedonic intentions rather than utilitarian needs. Second, our research spans both low-cost and high-cost markets. Adobe products are ideal for this research as Adobe offers products in both the PC market and the mobile market, both of which deal with high rates of piracy (Smith 2015, Jacobson 2012). As such, we can control for brand preferences but still investigate differences in the PC (high-cost) and mobile (low-cost) markets. Third, Adobe Photoshop products are among the most pirated consumer software products in the industry. In fact, the number of BitTorrent seeds for Adobe Photoshop is more than double that of Microsoft Ofﬁce (Muchmore 2012). Finally, Adobe recently made changes to its product line with the introduction of a free limited capability version (Photoshop Express for PC and mobile) and a premium version (Adobe CS6 for PC, and Adobe Photoshop Touch Exp for mobile market). Thus, Adobe Photoshop products enable us to use real product line extensions in our experimental settings, thereby increasing the external validity of the experimental design. As hypothesized, we anticipate that consumers’ WTP valuations of the focal product will be impacted differently depending on whether the market is high cost (such as a traditional PC software market) or low cost (such as the relatively new emergent mobile software market). To test our theory, we conduct two controlled experiments.1 In Study 1, we test our theory in a traditional PC software market (representative of a high-cost market) using Adobe Photoshop Elements (retail $99) as our focal digital product. For our treatment, we

288 to affect consumers’ choice (i.e., decision to purchase or not) through their WTP valuations and should also have an impact on consumers’ piracy intentions. We measured “social inﬂuence” because a large body of research has found that consumers purchase products and services that are used by inﬂuential others (e.g., Venkatesh et al. 2012). This implies that consumers are looking for software that meets their objective needs and is also used by those around them—and in particular by those who have inﬂuence over them. Notably, it is unclear whether social inﬂuence will push consumers toward legitimate purchases (increase WTP and decrease piracy intentions) or illegitimate purchases (decrease WTP and increase piracy intentions). We also measured “product feature value.” IS research has traditionally focused on usefulness and ease of use as important determinants of systems adoption. Borrowing from this perspective, Raghu et al. (2009) showed that the perception of product usefulness is an important value determinant. We also posit that when consumers feel there is a high feature value in a product, they will be more willing to purchase the product through legitimate channels. Thus, high feature value should have a negative impact on consumers’ propensity to pirate. Most analytical models of piracy behavior make this fundamental assumption (Conner and Rumelt 1991, Gopal and Sanders 1997). In addition, we measured participants’ previous use of photo editing software as well as participants’ familiarity with other free photo editing software products. Using these covariates we are able to control for differences in participants’ product level and competition level knowledge of each market. We include participants’ previous use and familiarity with the competition in both the piracy and WTP valuations equations. Finally, we measured consumers’ “brand perceptions.” It is well known that consumers often form an afﬁnity to certain brands. In turn, strong positive perceptions toward a speciﬁc brand of product may inﬂuence consumers to remain loyal to the focal product irrespective of the price, external stimuli, other alternatives, or market type (Kirmani et al. 1999, Homburg et al. 2005, Park et al. 2010, Heath et al. 2011). As a result, consumers with strong brand perceptions should react differently to piracy controls and product line extensions than consumers with weak brand perceptions. We include this variable as a covariate and a moderator of consumers WTP valuations in our analysis. In §4, we discuss our WTP estimation methodology for both studies. We then review Studies 1 and 2 followed by a demand analysis for each study.

WTP Methodology for Studies 1 and 2

We use a demand-based approach to estimate consumers’ WTP valuations and piracy intentions for the focal product. However, to estimate changes in incumbent product demand due to product line extensions and piracy controls, it is important to account for pirates, i.e., those individuals who would never purchase the incumbent’s product at any nonzero price. In other words, it is essential that our model allows for the existence of an endogenously estimated group of consumers whose WTP for the legitimate product is always zero. To do so, we utilize the product piracy model proposed recently in Sinha et al. (2010). This model is an effective way to achieve our goals because it allows us to test the impact of product line extension and piracy control while isolating and controlling for those consumers who would use but never pay for the product, i.e., the likely pirates. The empirical model in Sinha et al. (2010) builds on the double-bound-dichotomous-choice (DBDC) contingent valuation method (CVM) that originated in economics (Bishop and Heberlein 1979; Hanemann 1984, 1994). The CVM has also been increasingly used in the literature on private goods, particularly to assess WTP while using survey or experimental data collection methods (Cameron and James 1987, Park and MacLachlan 2008, Sinha and Mandel 2008, Raghu et al. 2009, Lopes and Galletta 2006). Many alternative techniques for estimating WTP have also been proposed in the literature. These range from very simple procedures that merely ask consumers to state their WTP, to more sophisticated models such as lotteries, auctions, and choice-based experiments such as conjoint analysis. Although there is no consensus that any one method is clearly preferable to the other (Stevens et al. 2000, Hanley et al. 2001, Foster and Mourato 2003), empirical evidence suggests that carefully designed CVM studies yield both reliable and valid estimates of WTP in survey-based experimental research (Arrow et al. 1993, Carson et al. 2001). CVM experiments have been used in both public good and private good contexts. By deﬁnition, a public good exhibits qualities of nonrivalry (simultaneous consumption by one individual does not diminish consumption for other individuals) and nonexcludability (one cannot completely prevent individuals from consuming the good). However, it is difﬁcult to identify a purely public good. In a review of CVM studies, Murphy and Stevens (2004) suggest that CVM studies may be less prone to bias in private good contexts. Since software products embody some characteristics of both public and private goods, the CVM approach is particularly appropriate for this study. Survey-based studies that have tested CVM approaches in a private goods context include sports cards (List 2001), pens

289 Individuals are randomly assigned to one of the bid sets. The bid sets used in the literature for WTP estimation with known product prices, anchor the middle bid set at the prevailing price and introduce bid sets on either side of the anchor (Sinha and Mandel 2008, Raghu et al. 2009, Sinha et al. 2010). The four outcomes may be represented as (No-No) if WTP < BL , (No-Yes) if BL ≤ WTP < B1 , (Yes-No) if B1 ≤ WTP < BH , and (Yes-Yes) if BH ≤ WTP. The main advantage of the DBDC CVM approach over simply asking respondents to state a price they are willing to pay (which has been known to be inﬂuenced by random cues) and conjoint models is that it more closely resembles consumer choice in an actual market situation, where consumers are given prices (as opposed to being faced with open-ended questions, attribute descriptions, or lotteries). For instance, conjoint analysis elicits preference information on attribute bundles that are useful from a product design perspective. However, given our focus on WTP in the presence of alternatives, we are less interested in pair-wise attribute bundle valuations and more interested in the relative overall valuation of a product already in the market. The simple Yes/No responses place limited cognitive burden on the respondents. In addition, since the stated prices vary across subsamples, no single respondent can inﬂuence the ﬁnal outcome. As a result, the DBDC CVM technique is less susceptible to gaming and strategic behavior (Mitchell and Carson 1989). To incorporate the consumer segment that will never buy the product, Sinha et al. (2010) develop a mixture model for the DBDC CVM approach by asking the (No-No) group if they would pay anything at all. Those who responded negatively (No-No-No group) were considered likely to be pirates. We reﬁne this approach further by identifying individuals who (a) indicate that they would pirate, or (b) indicate that they would borrow the product from someone else, as true pirates.

(Wertenbroch and Skiera 2002) and quasi-public goods such as paying for recycling (Aadland and Caplan 2006). A number of researchers have used CVM to measure WTP for digital goods including Homburg et al. (2005), Sinha and Mandel (2008), Raghu et al. (2009), and Sinha et al. (2010). A concern in CVM-based WTP elicitation is hypothetical bias—where respondents overstate their true willingness to pay for the product. A “cheap talk” procedure (List 2001) has been used to address this issue and we utilize a similar approach in this research. Importantly, the factorial experimental design mitigates the hypothetical bias since the experiment is designed to show relative WTP valuations across experimental conditions (i.e., the relative impact of vertical product extensions and piracy controls) rather than ﬁnding a speciﬁc value of WTP. 4.1. Contingent Valuation and WTP We present the main ideas underlying the DBDC CVM here and explain the estimation procedure in §4.2. WTP is deﬁned as the amount that a consumer is willing to forego that makes the consumer indifferent between purchasing and not purchasing. In a random utility framework, a vector of covariates is assumed to affect the utility underlying the consumer WTP. Rather than asking respondents to state their WTP, DBDC CVM procedure presents respondents with bids and asks them whether they would be willing to pay that amount. Speciﬁcally, respondents are presented with a sequence of two bids from the set (BL < B1 < BH ) and asked if their willingness to pay equals or exceeds those bids. The sequence of bids depends on the answer (yes/no) to the ﬁrst bid (B1 ) as shown in Figure 3. Multiple bid sets are used in the WTP survey such that the support for the WTP distribution can be enhanced with more information. The main objective is to place upper and lower bounds on a consumer’s unobserved true WTP. Multiple bid sets are used in the WTP survey such that the support for the WTP distribution can be enhanced with more information.

290 4.2. Estimation Procedure The empirical approach is designed to estimate product demand under conditions of product piracy. Accordingly, the conceptualization of piracy involved the following two-step procedure. Step A. Estimating WTP. First, we asked all respondents in the (No-No) group whether they would be willing to “pay anything at all.” This gave us the “NoNo-No” group of respondents (i.e., those respondents who said “No” to the initial bid presented to them, “No” to the subsequent lower follow-up bid, and ﬁnally also “No” to the follow-up question asking them whether they would pay anything at all for the software). Then, to rule out other factors for not wishing to pay anything at all, we asked all of the respondents in the (No-No-No) group additional questions that represent their reasoning for the three successive No’s: (a) would use a pirated copy of Adobe Photoshop; (b) borrow Adobe Photoshop from someone else; (c) use a free alternative to Adobe Photoshop; (d) purchase a different photo editing software or service from another company; and (e) do not need Adobe Photoshop. Only those respondents from the (No-No-No) group who marked (a) or (b) were considered likely to be pirates. Hence, for individual j Pr(No-No) = Pr WTPj ≤ B1j and WTPj ≤ BLj = Pr WTPj ≤ B1j WTPj ≤ BLj Pr WTPj ≤ BLj = Pr WTPj ≤ BLj = F BLj since BLj < B1j (1)

for piracy, we deﬁne two groups of consumers as follows: (a) Group A consists of individuals whose WTP is “always zero.” These are the “true” pirates and are observed with probability pj . This probability may be modeled as a function of individual covariates Xij in a logit model. ˜ consists of individuals whose WTP (b) Group A is “not always zero.” These individuals may or may not purchase the software and are observed with probability 1 − pj . We do not know which group a randomly drawn individual belongs to, but we do know that Pr WTP = 0 A Xij = 1 and that Pr WTP = k A Xij = 0, k > 0. Hence Pr WTP = 0 Xij ˜ Xij · Pr A ˜ = Pr WTP = 0 A + Pr WTP = 0 A Xij Pr A ˜ Xij · Pr A ˜ + Pr A = Pr WTP = 0 A ˜ Xij = pj + 1 − pj Pr WTP = 0 A Pr WTP = k Xij ˜ Xij Pr A ˜ = Pr WTP = k A + Pr WTP = k A Xij Pr A ˜ Xij Pr A ˜ = Pr WTP = k A ˜ Xij = 1 − pj Pr WTP = k A (6) (5)

where F BLj is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for WTP with parameter vector . The covariates and experimental controls are used to estimate the parameter vectors. Similarly Pr (Yes-Yes) = Pr WTPj > B1j and WTPj > BHj = 1 − F BHj Pr (Yes-No) = Pr WTPj > B1j and WTPj ≤ BHj = F BHj − F B1j and (3) (2)

Letting nnn, nn, ny, yn, and yy represent dummy indicators for the (No-No-No), (No-No), (No-Yes), (Yes-No), and (Yes-Yes) group, respectively, Equations (1)–(6) yield a sample log-likelihood of

Pr (No-Yes) = Pr WTPj ≤ B1j and WTPj > BLj = F B1j − F BLj (4)

Equations (1)–(4) represent the probabilities of observing the different responses to each of the individual bids and yield the likelihood function for estimating the mean WTP for the sample. Step B. Jointly Estimating WTP and Propensity for Piracy. To jointly estimate WTP and the propensity

The parameters of the distribution can be speciﬁed as a function of covariates. Consequently, the model is able to incorporate the differential impact of covariates on both the probability of piracy (pj ) and the distribution of WTP for “nonpirates.” This feature is used in the empirical application for ascertaining the impact of experimental conditions on piracy and WTP. Estimation of the piracy rate enables us to identify market size for different price offerings and compute the consumer and producer surplus. Finally, the probability of piracy

Additionally, it was explained to the respondent that the user may not be able to use certain features of the software if it was not activated. Conﬁrmation of the respondents’ understanding of the strength of the piracy controls was obtained by asking follow-up, veriﬁcation questions. Respondents randomly assigned to the low piracy control condition were shown a much more liberal licensing agreement that speciﬁcally asked the respondent to assume that the Adobe licensing agreement allowed the purchaser to (1) install and use a copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements on as many computers and devices as they wish, even if they only purchased one copy of the software; (2) copy Adobe Photoshop Elements as many times as they wish for use on any computer or device; and (3) give copies of Adobe Photoshop Elements to others. Additionally, it was explained to the participants that registration was not required and a license key was not needed for activation. Full features of the product would be completely available immediately after any installation of the product. Conﬁrmation of the respondents’ understanding of the nonexistent piracy control was obtained by asking three follow-up, veriﬁcation questions (all survey instruments are available as part of Online Appendix A (available as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/isre.2016.0621)). Respondents randomly assigned to the low vertical extension (LE) experimental condition were ﬁrst introduced to the “existing” product line prior to the introduction of the low or free extension. Thus, participants ﬁrst viewed the focal product (Adobe Photoshop Elements) along with the premium product (Adobe CS6) with a description of the prices of each and the features included within each. Next, respondents were presented with a description of Adobe Photoshop Express, which is a free online product that provides a limited set of the most commonly used Adobe Photoshop Elements features. Participants were explicitly shown how all three Adobe products compared to one another. Basic features such as retouching or manipulating pictures’ color, size, effects, etc., were emphasized and the price ($0 as compared to $99.99)

can be estimated with a simple logit model speciﬁed for the probabilities in (7). Since the objective is to estimate the WTP distribution, the estimation procedure provides the aggregate statistical properties of the WTP distribution and not the WTP at the individual respondent level.

Study 1

The purpose of this study is to test how the introduction of a free or premium extension and different levels of piracy controls impact the WTP valuations, piracy intentions, and consumer/producer surplus in a highcost or traditional PC software market. In this study, we make use of three Adobe Photoshop products: (1) the online free version of Adobe Photoshop (the low vertical extension), (2) Adobe Photoshop Elements (the focal product), and (3) Adobe CS6 (the premium vertical extension). We expect that consumers will give lower WTP values to products with high piracy controls, but give higher WTP values to products with low piracy controls. Additionally, since consumers’ product evaluations are context dependent, we anticipate that in this high-cost market consumers will give higher WTP valuations to a focal product when a free vertical extension is introduced as opposed to when a premium vertical extension is introduced. 5.1. Design and Procedure We recruited 815 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and conducted a 2 (piracy control: Low versus High) × 2 (Low Extension (LE) versus High Extension (HE)) between subjects experiment with Adobe Photoshop (PS) Elements as the focal product (see Table 1). All respondents were provided with an initial description of Adobe Photoshop Elements, the current retail price of $99.99, and a summary of basic features (e.g., image editing, creating photo books, sharing images on social media platforms, etc.). Participants were at least 18 years of age. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions. Those in the high piracy control condition were presented with information regarding the standard Adobe Photoshop Elements licensing agreement stating that the software was for the exclusive use of the primary user and that it was

292 was also emphasized. Follow-up veriﬁcation questions were used to verify understanding of the essential aspects of this free offering (i.e., free, used online, only basic features offered). Respondents randomly assigned to the high vertical extension (HE) experimental condition were ﬁrst shown the focal product (Adobe Photoshop Elements) along with the free product (Adobe Photoshop Express) in conjunction with the corresponding prices and features. Participants were then given a description of Adobe Photoshop CS6 for a total of $149.99. Participants were explicitly shown how all three Adobe products compared to one another. The photo editing and sharing features of Adobe CS6 were also emphasized along with the price. Respondents were subsequently asked questions to verify understanding of the essential aspects of this offering (i.e., the additional features included in Adobe CS6). We want to be very clear that in both the high and low vertical extension conditions, participants were asked to make a WTP valuation while viewing all three versions of the product (Adobe Photoshop Express, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and Adobe CS6). The only difference between the high and low vertical extension conditions—the context in which the valuation was dependent—was how the existing market was portrayed prior to the introduction of the vertical extension (see Figure 1). Thus, in the low vertical extension condition participants viewed the premium product and focal product before the free extension was introduced. In the high vertical extension condition, participants viewed the free and focal product before the premium extension was introduced. That the end result is the same for both conditions is consistent with the context dependent preferences literature (Tversky and Simonson 1993) and allows us to assess how incumbents can best approach a market. In other words, we do not assess the ﬁnal product lineup, but rather the impact of how incumbents sequence the full product lineup in relation to the focal product. Using this experimental design, we are able to isolate the speciﬁc context dependent preferences that we are interested in investigating—the introduction of a vertical product extension in a high-cost market. As a result of this random assignment, individual differences (such as previous experience with the product, feature valuations, beliefs about the ﬁrm, etc.) are averaged across all experimental conditions. Thus, causality can be hypothesized to be the result of the randomly assigned independent variables: vertical product extensions (high versus low) and privacy controls (high versus low). Prior to continuing with the survey, respondents gave a valuation of each of the basic features common to all of the products considered in the experiment (e.g., organizing photos, retouching photos, sharing photos on social media, etc.) based on a 7 point Likert scale

(1–Not at all valuable; 4–Neutral; 7–Extremely valuable). Feature comparisons for the vertical extensions were also separately presented in the corresponding experimental conditions. Respondents were asked to provide their WTP for the focal product (Adobe Photoshop Elements) after exposure to the experimental conditions and after responding to experimental design veriﬁcation questions (manipulation checks). Respondents were randomly assigned to one of ﬁve potential bid sets for use in CVM evaluation. Using the Adobe Photoshop Elements market price of $99.99 as the basis, we built ﬁve distinct bid sets: ($59.99–$39.99–$79.99); ($79.99– $59.99–$99.99); ($99.99–$79.99–$119.99); ($119.99–$99.99– $139.99); and ($139.99–$119.99–$159.99), where each number represents (bid1, subsequent lower bid, subsequent higher bid). We pretested and piloted the contingent valuation survey language and the bid sets with a subject group similar to the one used in this study. From an estimation perspective several bid sets are required. The ﬁve bid sets used here are centered on Adobe Photoshop Elements’ offered price of $99.99. The results of the CVM section of the survey were used to estimate the WTP distribution. The estimated WTP distribution and piracy rate (derived from those who will never pay anything) was then used to analyze the demand distribution—which enables us to estimate consumer and producer surplus as well as the welfare maximizing price point for the different experimental conditions. Finally, respondents were exposed to questions for multi-item measures including brand perceptions, perceived price fairness, propensity to share, social inﬂuence, product feature value, and performance expectations. The items are described in Table 2 and were adapted from relevant previous literature. 5.2. Descriptive Statistics We reached out to a total of 815 (of whom 814 completed the study) participants using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (see Table 3 for a description of the sample). Previous researchers have shown that variances in completion time do have an impact on the accuracy of responses in survey research (Meade and Bartholomew 2012). The mean response time was 8.5 minutes and the median was 8 minutes. This study included approximately 1,700 words of instructions and questions and should take at least ﬁve minutes to read—the average individual reads approximately 300 words per minute (Nelson 2012). Researchers have found that participants who take studies too quickly are not paying attention (Steelman et al. 2014). As a result, we removed respondents from our sample who took less than ﬁve minutes to complete the study, for validity purposes. Additionally, any participants that took an extreme amount of time to complete the study—longer than 30 minutes, which is more than 4 standard deviations

Survey Constructs and Items Items The Adobe brand is important to me. The Adobe brand is relevant to me. I have frequently thought about the Adobe brand. I am conﬁdent with my evaluation of the Adobe brand. I am certain that my evaluation of Adobe as a brand is correct. The retail price of Adobe Photoshop Elements—$99.99 (Touch—$4.99) is fair. The retail price of Adobe Photoshop Elements—$99.99 (Touch—$4.99) is reasonable. The retail price of Adobe Photoshop Elements—$99.99 (Touch—$4.99) is just. I like to share the things that I have. Everybody beneﬁts when we share what we have with each other. I share what I have so others don’t have to spend money on the same things. I use the same photo editing software as my friends. I pay attention to the software that my friends use, and then make similar purchase decisions. Others that I know use the same photo editing software as I do. I use the same photo editing software as the people in my life who are important to me. I use the same photo editing software as those who have some inﬂuence on my behavior. I use the same photo editing software as those whose opinions I value. I am conﬁdent in the ability of Adobe Photoshop Elements (Touch) to perform well. I am certain that Adobe Photoshop Elements (Touch) would perform as well as similar products. Considering the performance of Adobe Photoshop Elements (Touch), there would not be much risk in choosing to use Adobe Photoshop Elements (Touch). Have you used ANY type of photo editing software at least once (e.g., Photoshop Express, Photoshop Elements, Photoshop CS6, or non-Adobe products)?

WTP Distribution Using the maximum likelihood model for WTP distribution estimation given the propensity for piracy that we described earlier, the CVM data collected from the survey were ﬁtted to a Gumbel distribution because they exhibited the best ﬁt (Akaike information criterion; AIC). Three equations were utilized to simultaneously estimate coefﬁcients associated with the piracy rate and the WTP distribution location and scale. As a ﬁrst step, the cell means for WTP and piracy rates were estimated without introducing any covariates.2 The dollar value of mean WTP was obtained through estimation of Gumbel distribution parameters (location and scale). The probability of piracy is given by p = e x / 1 + e x , where x is the estimated pirating propensity equation. The cell means are reported in Table 4 (standard deviation for the study sample WTP was 40.9). Highest mean WTP is observed in the cell (PC = LOW, EXT = LE), and is signiﬁcantly different from that of (HIGH, HE) (p = 0 01), marginally signiﬁcantly different from (LOW, HE) (p = 0 10), but not signiﬁcantly different from that of (HIGH, LE) (p = 0 29). The (HIGH, HE) cell mean was the lowest WTP and is marginally signiﬁcantly different from that of (HIGH, LE) (p = 0 10), but not different from (LOW, HE) (p = 0 29). The cell mean in the (LOW, HE) condition is also not different from that in (HIGH, LE) (p = 0 55). The piracy rate is lowest for the (HIGH, LE) condition and highest in the (LOW, HE). As predicted in Hypothesis 1A, in a high-cost market consumers’ WTP for the focal product is higher when a free vertical extension is introduced, than when a premium vertical extension is introduced. We anticipated this outcome because in a high-cost market quality signals are already associated with price. Thus, the introduction of a premium product does not improve quality associations or WTP valuations. However, when a free vertical extension is introduced, the focal product WTP valuations beneﬁt from the positive affect boost associated with the free offering. We also ﬁnd support for Hypothesis 2 that premium vertical extensions increase consumers’ propensity to pirate. Finally, we ﬁnd support for Hypothesis 3 that piracy controls will have a negative impact on piracy intentions, and Hypothesis 4 that piracy controls will have a negative impact on WTP.

Study 2

The purpose of Study 2 is to investigate whether vertical product extensions have the same impact within a low-cost software market. In this study, we also make use of three Adobe Photoshop products but we use applications that are available on mobile platforms: Photoshop Express (free low vertical extension), Photoshop Touch (focal product), and Photoshop Touch Exp (premium vertical extension). In this study, we expect to ﬁnd that in a low-cost market, consumers’ WTP valuations will be higher for premium product extensions than low—or free—product extensions, the opposite of high-cost markets (Study 1). 6.1. Design and Procedure We use the same study design, procedure, and WTP estimations used in Study 1. However, we change the products and the bid sets to accurately represent the product logos and prices reﬂected in low-cost markets such as what is exhibited on the mobile platform. Thus, using the Adobe Photoshop Touch market price of $4.99 as the basis, we built ﬁve distinct bid sets: ($1.99– $0.49–$3.49); ($3.49–$1.99–$4.99); ($4.99–$3.49–$6.49); ($6.49–$4.99–$7.99); and ($7.99–$6.49–$9.49), where each set represents (bid1, subsequent lower bid, subsequent higher bid). 6.2. Descriptive Statistics We reached out to a total of 776 (746 of whom completed the study) participants using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Just as in Study 1, we removed participants who completed the survey in less than 5 minutes or took longer than 30 minutes (mean response time was 9.3 minutes and the median was 8 minutes) and respondents who answered more than one out of the three manipulation check questions incorrectly in each experimental factor for validity purposes. A total of 623 (83.5%) participants qualiﬁed for the study (see Table 3 for a description of the sample). Approximately equal numbers of respondents were exposed to each experimental condition (PC Low + LE = 157 respondents; PC High + LE = 145 respondents; PC Low + HE = 163 respondents; PC High + HE = 158 respondents). 6.3.

295 were adequate (all correlations < 0 40), the construct items loaded separately on distinct factors in a rotated (oblique) conﬁrmatory factor analysis, the average variance extracted (AVE) for these constructs were all above 0.5, and the square roots of the AVEs for each construct were higher than all interconstruct correlations, suggesting good discriminant validity. The Cronbach’s alphas were greater than 0.70 and the composite reliabilities (CR) were all greater than 0.70, suggesting good convergent reliability. We also created a composite for perceived feature value. The Cronbach’s alpha was greater than 0.70 and the CR was also greater than 0.70. The AVE was less than the preferred 0.50, however, the square root of the AVE was greater than the interconstruct correlations. Therefore, given that our method is maximum likelihood based, we consider this to be a reliable and valid composite. Table 6 reports the result of a simultaneous equation approach. Among the covariates in the ﬁrst equation and their impact on piracy rates, increased “perceived feature” value has a negative impact on piracy rates in all models, supporting existing research that higher feature valuations are likely to result in reduced piracy rates (Conner and Rumelt 1991, Gopal and Sanders 1997). Additionally, higher levels of perceived “price fairness” are also likely to decrease overall piracy rates. “Sharing” propensity also has a signiﬁcant positive effect in all models, suggesting that positive attitudes toward sharing increase piracy rates in all software markets. Consumers in mobile markets may be more comfortable with the idea of sharing because many applications in the mobile industry are designed to share (i.e., photos, gaming, messages, locations, etc.). We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant impact of “social inﬂuence” in any of the markets, which suggests that piracy is not speciﬁcally a function of ownership among a consumer’s network. We also ﬁnd that “brand perception” has a negative marginally signiﬁcant relationship with piracy rate in the Adobe (traditional high-cost) market, suggesting that a strong brand may actually decrease consumers’ propensity to pirate software. Finally, neither “Previous Use” nor “Familiarity with Competition” had a signiﬁcant impact on piracy rates. Among the covariates in the second equation and their impact on the WTP distribution, “feature rating,” “price fairness,” and “social inﬂuence” all positively and signiﬁcantly impacted WTP. Thus, increases to any of these variables also increase overall WTP valuations of the focal product. Additionally, we ﬁnd that “performance” has a marginally signiﬁcant positive relationship on WTP valuations in the high-price market and a signiﬁcant positive relationship on WTP valuations in the low-price market. Participants’ familiarity with the competition did not have a signiﬁcant impact in the WTP equations for either the low cost

data we collected to a Gumbel distribution (AIC). We used the same procedure as in Study 1 to calculate the cell means for WTP and piracy rates without introducing any covariates.3 The cell means are reported in Table 5 (standard deviation for the study sample WTP was 3.61). The highest mean WTP is observed in the cell (PC = LOW, EXT = HE), and is signiﬁcantly different from that of (HIGH, LE) (p < 0 001 , (HIGH, HE) (p = 0 002), and (LOW, LE) (p = 0 003) cells. The lowest cell mean was in the (HIGH, LE) cell and is signiﬁcantly different from the (LOW, LE) (p = 0 002) and (HIGH, HE) (p = 0 003) cells. The cell mean in (LOW, LE) condition is not different from that in the (HIGH, HE) cell (p = 0 88). Thus, we ﬁnd evidence to support Hypothesis 1B that consumers’ WTP valuations in a low-cost market will be higher when a premium rather than free vertical product extension is introduced into the market. We expected this result because in a low-cost market the addition of the premium product extension provides a quality signal that extends to the focal product. However, because the market is already low cost, the beneﬁt of the affective evaluation from the free product extension is negligible. Additionally, we replicate the ﬁndings of Study 1 and ﬁnd additional support for Hypothesis 3 that piracy controls will have a negative impact on piracy intentions and Hypothesis 4 that piracy controls will have a negative impact on WTP valuations. However, we ﬁnd the opposite results from Study 1 with regard to Hypothesis 2, where in the low-cost market, premium vertical extensions decrease consumers’ propensity to pirate.

or high cost market. Previous use of a photo editing software only had a signiﬁcant (positive) impact on the WTP equation in the Android (low-cost) market. We expect that this is due to the fact that both the product and the market are relatively new. Thus, consumers who are more familiar with the product and how well it functions are willing to pay more for the product. Finally, we ﬁnd that although the main effect of “brand perceptions” is inconsistent across the different equations, it moderates WTP valuations for highand low-priced markets differentially. For instance, in the high-cost market, brand perception interacts with piracy controls such that as brand perceptions increase, consumers’ WTP for products with piracy controls also increases. However, consumers’ WTP for products with no piracy controls decreases. This would suggest that for products in a high-cost market, brand perceptions have a magnifying effect on WTP valuations because consumers see the inherent value in piracy controls. In the low-cost market on the other hand, brand perceptions have a marginally signiﬁcant interaction with the product line extension. In this case, the premium vertical extension increases consumers’ WTP more for consumers with low brand perceptions of the product than for consumers with high brand perceptions of the product. Importantly, by controlling for these variables, we can eliminate them as alternative explanations for the vertical product extension context dependent effects and piracy control differences in both the low-cost and high-cost markets. A key advantage of simultaneous estimation of WTP and piracy rate is that it enables the computation of overall conditional demand (given piracy) for the focal product in response to the changes in the experimental conditions. We present the demand analysis results in §7.2. Assuming zero marginal costs of production, expected revenue was used as a proxy for producer surplus. 7.2. Demand Analyses Given the piracy rates and WTP distribution parameters (distribution scale and location) estimated for each experimental condition (without covariates), a demand analysis was conducted (for more details, see the demand analysis spreadsheet example shown in Online Appendix B). The conditional probability of purchase was estimated using the scale and location parameters for the estimated WTP distribution. Prices were incremented in $5.00 intervals from $0 to $160 (based on the highest bid-set value in the experiment—$159.99). The probability of purchase was discounted by the piracy rate to arrive at an estimated percentage of consumers with a WTP at the given price (i.e., demand). Revenue to the producer was then calculated by multiplying the given price by the portion of those consumers with an estimated willingness to pay at that price. As an example, with piracy

297 whether they are in a high-cost or low-cost market. Importantly, we want to point out that the results of the demand analysis suggest that although piracy controls may reduce piracy intentions (Hypothesis 3), producers and consumers are both best served by a reduction in piracy controls. In the PC (high-cost) market, we suggest that an incumbent can increase welfare by (a) reducing prices, (b) introducing piracy controls, and (c) extending the existing product line at the low end. As suggested earlier, the free vertical extension creates positive affect that impacts consumers’ preference for the focal product. As such, a ﬁrm that currently has offerings in a high-cost market would beneﬁt from introducing a free vertical extension of their product. Allowing consumers to try out the product prior to committing to the purchase price has the additional potential to create positive affect toward the focal product. In the high-cost PC market, this may be particularly enticing to consumers. In the mobile (low-cost) market, we show that an incumbent can increase demand by (a) minimally reducing prices (by ∼$0.5), (b) reducing piracy controls, and (c) extending the existing product line at the high end. We suggest that this is due to the quality signal that introducing a premium extension has on the focal product. Future research should examine the price point at which these two vertical extension strategies meet. A better understanding of this difference will be useful for managerial decisions made when digital products exist within the same market but at discrepant (very high versus very low) price points.

control = Low and product extension = LE, consider an offer price of $25. The estimated piracy rate for the experimental condition was approximately 10%. The log-logistic conditional probability for WTP = $25 was 94.00%. The estimated demand at that price was (94.00% × (1%–10%)) approximately 85%. Therefore, revenue at this price point was (85% × 100 × $25) approximately $2,114. The revenues computed at each price point form the basis for calculating producer surplus (for the given price, under the given experimental conditions). Consumer surplus at the retail price of the focal product was calculated by ﬁnding the area under the estimated distribution curve beyond the retail price of the focal product ($99.99–PC market, $4.99–mobile market). We deﬁned optimal price as the price point at which producer surplus was maximized. The consumer surplus at the optimal point would be the area under the estimated distribution curve beyond the optimal price point. The demand analyses for each of the four experimental conditions of both Studies 1 and 2 are summarized in Tables 7 and 8. Remarkably, in both high-cost and low-cost contexts, producer and consumer interests are aligned at both current and optimal prices and our investigation of consumer and producer surplus has useful insights for software markets. Whereas academic literature on pricing strategies and piracy primarily focus on producer surplus, we empirically show the impact of these ﬁrm strategies on consumer and producer surplus. Thus, we are able to suggest different approaches for incumbents to introduce vertical product extensions with different levels of piracy control depending on

Whereas the extant literature supports lower levels of piracy controls from the perspective of improving producer surplus (Conner and Rumelt 1991, Givon et al. 1995, Gopal and Sanders 1997), we show that relaxed piracy controls may actually be welfare maximizing, especially in low-cost markets. Moreover, at the current marketplace prices, relaxed piracy controls improve welfare in both markets. Additionally, the optimal prices computed indicate that both consumer and producer surplus can increase in response to price reductions irrespective of experimental conditions, however, care should be taken with this implication because our main concern is with the relative WTP elicitation rather than the absolute WTP elicitation.

cost (such as the mobile market) or high cost (such as the traditional PC market). We present an approach for computing consumer and producer surplus under various conditions by estimating both WTP and piracy rate. This approach overcomes the shortcomings of WTP as the sole proxy for consumer valuation by also accounting for changes in piracy rates in the market that result from ﬁrm level decisions. As such, we ﬁnd there are substantial differences in how producers should approach both high-cost and low-cost markets to maximize consumer and producer welfare. 8.1. Willingness to Pay We ﬁnd strong support for our research hypotheses related to consumer valuation. The WTP for the focal product is most responsive to a product line extension and not as responsive to changes in piracy control. The WTP ﬁndings build on the nascent demand-side research on piracy and WTP in the IS literature. We ﬁnd support for Hypothesis 1A, that in a high-cost market consumers’ WTP valuations are highest when a free vertical extension is introduced. We anticipated this result because in a high-cost market the positive affect associated with the introduction of the free product positively inﬂuences consumers’ valuations of the focal product. We ﬁnd the reverse effect in a low-cost market and, consequently, support for Hypothesis 1B. Consumers’ WTP valuations in a low-cost market were highest when a premium vertical extension was introduced. We also anticipated this outcome because of the fact that in a low-cost market a quality association— such as the one provided by the introduction of a

Discussion

The hypercompetitive nature of software markets and the competition with zero priced alternatives has created uncertainty as to how producers should align their market offerings. Consider the free online Adobe Photoshop that is currently available to PC consumers and, conversely, the free mobile Adobe Photoshop application that is available to mobile platform users (Reid 2015). Using context dependent preferences as our theoretical background, we contribute to the literature by showing that producers can inﬂuence the WTP valuations of their consumers by how they introduce vertical product extensions into the market and through the piracy controls that they place on those products. Importantly, we show that these effects are different depending on whether the market is low

299 to improve both consumer and producer surplus in high-cost and low-cost markets. Price fairness perception is a signiﬁcant psychological driver of piracy rate. A reason why piracy rates are high in the digital goods industry is that incumbents often set prices that are well above consumers’ WTP for the markets they address. For instance, in an analysis of global software piracy, Gopal and Sanders (2000) advocated for country speciﬁc software product prices as an antidote to extremely high piracy rates in emerging economies. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon was observed in the music industry where the unbundling of music CDs into singles somewhat mitigated the downward spiral of rampant music piracy through peer-to-peer sharing. Software vendors also create distinct versions for different market segments. The ﬁndings in this study indicate that there is further room for improvement in this area. For instance, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant impact of feature rating on piracy rate. As the feature rating increases, piracy intentions decrease. Firms can mitigate piracy intentions through improved content and features they include as part of their software offering. 8.3. Limitations We note some limitations of this study so that the results and implications can be understood in the right context. First, as with any contingent valuation study, external validity can be limited because of the lack of incentive compatibility in eliciting consumer WTP. We ﬁnd that the average WTP in our experimental conditions range from $70–$76 for the high-cost market and $4.5–$5.7 for the low-cost market depending on the experimental condition. These prices are below the market price anchor of $99 for Adobe Photoshop Elements, but span the $4.99 cost of Adobe Photoshop Touch. However, the WTP numbers are quite close to the offered price even with the incentive compatibility issues. Importantly, the estimations and our subsequent implications relied more on the relative comparisons between experimental conditions than the absolute values of WTP. A second limitation is that we assume zero marginal costs for the incumbent in the demand analysis and surplus computation. Whereas this assumption is consistent with extant literature on software products, care should be exercised in extending this line of reasoning to other product contexts where marginal costs may be material (e.g., products hosted on cloud computing platforms). Future research in this area should examine and extend the ﬁndings in other market segments.

premium vertical extension—would be a valuable signal to consumers. An important ﬁnding in Raghu et al. (2009) was that the usefulness of the product had a signiﬁcant impact on WTP. We reﬁned the deﬁnition of usefulness further in this study to elicit feature level valuations of the focal product and ﬁnd similar results. Essentially, consumer hedonic preferences for features will drive the WTP for products similar to Adobe Photoshop. Extant IS literature has seldom considered the ramiﬁcations of market oriented attributes of software products. We also ﬁnd that social inﬂuence is an important construct in determining consumer WTP valuations in both highcost and low-cost software markets in support of the extant literature that inﬂuential others have a positive impact on consumer adoption. Additionally, we ﬁnd there are positive effects of performance perceptions (marginally signiﬁcant in the high-cost market and signiﬁcant in the low-cost market) and price fairness perceptions on consumers WTP valuations. Finally, we showed that brand perceptions have a different moderating effect on consumers’ WTP valuations such that they interact with piracy controls (in the high-cost market) and product line extensions (in the low-cost market). These results in particular, point to a new direction in IS research where consumer software product valuations also consider brand perceptions in pricing and piracy control to rule out alternative explanations that could be the result of individual difference variables. 8.2. Piracy Rate Another key contribution of this work is the estimation of the propensity to pirate among subjects for consumer software. As would be expected, estimated piracy rates in the high-cost market were higher than those in the low-cost market. Irrespective of product extension controls, introduction of piracy controls lowered the piracy rate in both markets. However, the impact of vertical product line extension on piracy rate was different for both markets. In the high-cost market, consumers’ piracy intentions were higher when a premium extension was introduced, which also coincided with lower WTP valuations. However, in the low-cost market, consumers’ piracy intentions were highest when a free vertical extension was introduced, in contrast to previous research and our own Hypothesis 2. A key beneﬁt of piracy rate estimation is the ability to compute producer and consumer surplus under the different experimental conditions. This enabled us to estimate optimal product prices for each cell. We ﬁnd that at current and optimal prices, maximum consumer and producer surplus are well aligned in both high-cost and low-cost markets. Optimal prices in both markets were lower than the suggested price due to piracy. Thus, price reductions may have the potential

Conclusion

The main contribution of this research is the development and application of the context-dependent preference theory framework to analyzing consumer

300 valuation of software products in two different markets. Using two controlled experimental settings, we demonstrate the importance of product extension strategy in traditional high-cost and emergent low-cost consumer software markets. We show that individual differences in consumer perceptions also play an important role in determining propensity to pirate and willingness to pay, which also implies that researchers will improve the validity of their ﬁndings by controlling for these variables. Our ﬁndings, in the context of two speciﬁc consumer software products, show that welfare improvements are dependent on the type of market and the order in which product line extensions are introduced. Moreover, based on the empirical distribution, we show that price reductions may have the potential to improve both consumer and producer surplus. Although context-dependent preference theory framework opens up a promising new line of research into consumer software product markets, a number of important issues remain. Switching costs and loyalty concerns are important sources of competitive advantage for incumbents. It will be important to test if consumer valuations are moderated by these important factors. Another important consideration in product line extensions is moving into unrelated product categories (Heath et al. 2011). There is surprisingly little research in the IS literature on product diversiﬁcation and its impacts on incumbents in consumer software markets. Finally, the increasing shift toward subscription-based and service oriented approaches to software provisioning provide rich opportunities for IS researchers to make meaningful theoretical extensions in the domain of consumer software markets.
