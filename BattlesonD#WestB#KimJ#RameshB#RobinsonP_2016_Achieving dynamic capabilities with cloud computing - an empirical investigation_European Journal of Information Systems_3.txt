Abstract Cloud computing enables convenient and on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. While cloud computing‘s ability to improve operational efficiency has gained much attention in the literature, there has been limited research on how it can help organizations achieve dynamic capabilities. Drawing from dynamic capabilities theory, we conducted a field study using a multiple case study design to examine the following research question: How do organizations achieve dynamic capabilities by using Cloud Computing? We develop a framework that explains how organizations respond to market dynamism by developing sense-and-response strategies that enable them to achieve dynamic capabilities using business process redesign, business network redesign, and business scope redefinition. We discuss how these transformations, in turn, improve organizational outcomes such as service effectiveness and efficiency. Our study also identifies factors that support and hinder the development of dynamic capabilities. Our study contributes to the literature on dynamic capabilities by examining how IT capabilities like cloud computing may accelerate the ability of an organization to achieve dynamic capabilities. We also identify transformational changes of business processes and interorganizational networks that are enabled by cloud computing. Further, we identify how the essential characteristics of cloud computing support sense and respond strategies.

Introduction
The dynamic environment in which today’s organizations operate is shaping the way they are using IT resources and capabilities. Simply improving the operational efﬁciency of IT-enabled business processes may no longer be sufﬁcient to achieve agility, which is essential to operate in dynamic markets. Instead, organizations need to achieve signiﬁcant transformation of their IT-enabled business processes (Venkatraman, 1994). Cloud computing is an emerging technology paradigm that can enable organizations to become more agile and adapt to changes that are necessary to achieve such transformation. Cloud computing is deﬁned as ‘a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of conﬁgurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction’ (Mell & Grance, 2011, p. 2). The combination of the following ﬁve characteristics is essential for a technology

to be termed cloud computing (Mell & Grance, 2011; Trivedi, 2013): on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. While prior developments in IT have possessed some of these characteristics that help reconﬁgure IT resources in response to evolving needs, only recently the convergence of all the ﬁve characteristics has been achieved in what is currently termed as cloud computing. It helps organizations to move from a product- and ﬁrmcentric model of computing to a distributed service-centric model (Iyer & Henderson, 2010). According to a survey of 276 U.S. IT executives in 2013, cloud computing is used by 81% of their organizations and it ranks among the top three largest/most signiﬁcant IT investments in their ﬁrms (Brown, 2013). While traditional IT infrastructure poses challenges such as scalability and maintenance, cloud computing has the potential to signiﬁcantly mitigate these challenges (Armbrust et al, 2010). Potential advantages of cloud computing include ease of access to services using a web browser or programmable calls, minimal investment in IT infrastructure because the services may be priced similar to utilities with a ‘pay as you use’ model, and inﬁnitely expandable capacity and resources. A recent report concludes that government agencies moving to public or private clouds can save 50–67% in overall costs and that cloud computing is among the top concerns of IT executives in the medium term (Deltek, 2012). Not surprisingly, cloud computing has continued to grow rapidly and is at the top of the Gartner Magic Quadrant chart for emerging/disruptive technologies (Gartner, 2013). Because cloud computing is still an emerging phenomenon, most organizations are using it to improve their functional competencies (the ability to effectively execute operational processes) (Pavlou & El Sawy, 2006, p. 198). However, some organizations have recognized that cloud computing enables a fundamental shift in the way IT capabilities are delivered and it can be used to improve dynamic capabilities (the ability to reconﬁgure functional competencies to address turbulent environments) (Pavlou & El Sawy, 2006, p. 198). While the ability of cloud computing to improve functional competencies has gained much attention in the literature, research on how cloud computing can enable dynamic capabilities is limited. Dynamic capability is deﬁned as ‘the ﬁrm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconﬁgure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments’ (Teece et al, 1997, p. 516). Past research has established that IT is a key enabler of enterprise agility (Overby et al, 2006). IS strategy has been conceptualized to include IT architecture dynamic capability (Karimi-Alaghehband & Rivard, 2010), that is, the ability of a ﬁrm to create mutually reinforcing patterns of evolving, tightly aligned business strategy and IT capabilities (Teece, 2007). With cloud computing gaining widespread attention as an emerging IT architecture, the focus on dynamic capabilities enabled by cloud computing has signiﬁcant implications for organizational performance.

Studies on strategic management have extensively investigated the role of dynamic capabilities that enable organizations to manage their resources in response to turbulent environments (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Teece, 2007; Helfat et al, 2009). The important role of organizational processes and competences that enable managers to develop value-creation strategies has been well recognized (Amit & Zott, 2001; Lepak et al, 2007). Recent studies investigate how IT may be used to enable organizational processes and competencies and help organizations survive and prosper in turbulent business environments (Barreto, 2010; Helfat & Winter, 2011). Sambamurthy et al (2003) provide a general framework for studying IT-enabled dynamic capability. Recent empirical studies have reported that IT can enhance dynamic capabilities in various areas such as knowledge management (Sher & Lee, 2004), e-business (Daniel & Wilson, 2003; Koch, 2010), manufacturing (Banker et al, 2006), and health care (Singh et al, 2011). Cloud computing is increasingly being recognized as a potentially disruptive technology (Zhang et al, 2010; Narasimhan & Nichols, 2011a). There have been recent calls (Easterby-Smith et al, 2009) for focused studies on how dynamic capabilities may be achieved by disruptive technologies such as cloud computing. Our study attempts to address this call by investigating how organizations achieve dynamic capabilities by using cloud computing. Against this backdrop, we seek to offer contextually sensitive contributions to cloud computing research based on an explorative ﬁeld study of cloud computing in organizations. Following Teece’s (2007) call for studies on microfoundations of dynamic capabilities, that is, how organizations sense, seize, and reconﬁgure their resources for achieving dynamic capabilities, we investigate the following research question: How do organizations achieve dynamic capabilities by using Cloud Computing?

Theoretical background
Dynamic capabilities theory Dynamic capabilities theory draws upon research in multiple areas including management of R&D, technology transfer, manufacturing, and organizational learning (Teece et al, 1997). This theory extends the resource-based view (RBV), which theorizes that ‘when ﬁrms have resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and nonsubstitutable, they can achieve sustainable competitive advantage by implementing fresh value-creating strategies that cannot be easily duplicated by competing ﬁrms’ (Wernerfelt, 1984; Nelson, 1991; Peteraf, 1993; Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Barney et al, 2001 ). The dynamic capabilities theory focuses on two attributes that help achieve competitive advantage. The term ‘dynamic’ refers to the capacity to renew competences so as to achieve congruence with a changing business environment in which innovative responses are needed. The term ‘capabilities’ emphasizes the key role of strategic management in appropriately ‘adapting, integrating, and reconﬁguring

internal and external organizational skills, resources, and functional competences to match the requirements of a changing environment’ (Teece et al, 1997, p. 515). The dynamic capabilities theory seeks to explain how competitive advantage can be achieved by organizations in dynamic markets. Market dynamism can be of moderate velocity when small predictable changes occur or of high velocity when large unexpected changes occur. Eisenhardt & Martin (2000) state that moderately dynamic markets are ones in which change occurs frequently, but along roughly predictable linear paths. In contrast, when market dynamism is of high velocity, change becomes nonlinear or less predictable. The nature of dynamic capabilities varies with market dynamism. In moderately dynamic markets, routines that represent codiﬁed knowledge are detailed and speciﬁc with predictable results (Nelson & Winter, 2009). In contrast, in high-velocity markets, they may resemble simple, experiential, and unstable processes that lead to adaptive but unpredictable outcomes (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). Dynamic capabilities, while may be idiosyncratic in details, exhibit several common features such as the use of cross-functional teams, concrete and joint experiences among team members, and extensive external communication (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). Thus, the dynamic capabilities theory incorporates a rich conception of routines as efﬁcient and robust processes in moderately dynamic markets but fragile and semistructured ones in high velocity markets. While several studies empirically establish the link between dynamic capabilities and positive outcomes, Eriksson (2014) notes that the outcomes of dynamic capabilities are not always positive. Teece et al (1997, p. 518) suggests that the ‘essence of competences and capabilities is embedded in organizational processes’. However, he suggests that organizational resources play a signiﬁcant role in shaping these processes, and thus the competitive advantage that may be gained by the use of these processes. Recent research seeks to understand how IT resources can be exploited to achieve such capabilities. For example, Sambamurthy et al (2003) argue that digital platforms such as internet computing, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and supply chain management enable a ﬁrm to rapidly recognize changes and respond quickly to changing customer requirements. In line with this, Bharadwaj (2000) recognizes the role of the strategic management of organizational IT resources as an enabler of organizational agility. Prior studies note that IT infrastructure improves the ability of organizations to detect, process, and communicate information on emerging markets, thereby facilitating organizational sensing and responsiveness (Lu & Ramamurthy, 2011; Chakravarty et al, 2013). Thus, IT has been conceptualized as an enabler of organizational agility, a speciﬁc type of dynamic capability (Bharadwaj & Sambamurthy, 2005; Lu & Ramamurthy, 2011). D’Aveni (1994) views organizational agility as the ability to detect innovation opportunities and seize these opportunities by assembling assets, knowledge, and

relationships with speed and surprise. Agility encompasses an organization’s capabilities to interact with markets by exploring and exploiting opportunities for market arbitrage (Lee et al, 2015). Thus, agility is conceptualized as one of the dimensions of dynamic capability (Sambamurthy et al, 2003). Following Teece et al (1997), Sambamurthy et al (2003) highlight three dimensions of dynamic capability: digital options, agility, and entrepreneurial alertness. Organizations with dynamic capabilities have well-developed digital options in the form of digitized enterprise work processes and knowledge systems to automate, inform, and integrate activities. Organizational agility is the ability to detect opportunities for innovation and seize these opportunities by assembling requisite resources with speed. Entrepreneurial alertness enables organizations to explore their markets, detect any ignorance in the markets, and determine actionable opportunities. These dimensions play a mediating role between IT investments and organizational performance. Sambamurthy et al (2003) note that IT enables organizations to develop digital options and agility through entrepreneurial alertness. They suggest that organizations should own and apply process capitals (often enabled by IT). Similarly, an empirical study of 180 new product development (NPD) managers demonstrates how the effective use of IT functionality by business units can help build competitive advantage by reconﬁguring business processes (Pavlou & El Sawy, 2006). Organizations can use IT to increase their alertness and improve organizational agility to cope with the challenges they face in increasingly changing business environments. In particular, IT infrastructure capabilities are found to increase the alertness of an organization, speciﬁcally by developing capabilities for detecting and seizing marketing opportunities (Wang et al, 2013). In addition, IT can help increase various forms of organizational agility – from operational agility and market capitalization agility to strategic agility (Neumann & Fink, 2007; Lu & Ramamurthy, 2011). Extending the above observations on IT enablement of dynamic capabilities to cloud computing, our research seeks to explore how organizations achieve dynamic capabilities by using cloud computing.

Sense-and-respond approach Haeckel (1999) proposes a sense-and-respond approach to achieve and sustain dynamic capabilities. He advocates the design of business processes that enable organizations to sense and respond to unpredictable changes in the environment. Further, he advocates creating governance systems that empower organizational stakeholders by providing ‘context and coordination’ rather than instituting a command-and-control approach. This approach suggests four business design principles for creating an adaptive organization (Haeckel, 1999):
●

recreates commitments between people through procedures and accountability. Designing modular processes: Unlike mass customization in which a ﬁrm produces tailored responses at low cost, modular services facilitate mass customization by making it easier to snap together solutions to satisfy the user needs in an efﬁcient and expeditious manner. Designing processes that help learn: How cycles of learning signal when and how business procedures should be changed. Designing ﬁrm-speciﬁc governance mechanisms: How ﬁrms ensure clearly articulated expectations, responsibilities, and shared activities. In dynamic environments, this also means how governance principles are updated and practiced.

Lyytinen & Rose (2006) recognize that ‘dynamic and learned’ capabilities are critical for organizations. Speciﬁcally, they emphasize that it is important for organizations to be adaptive to the ‘individual and dynamic needs’ of customers and present the sense-and-respond framework (Haeckel, 1999) as an example of this orientation. We adopt this framework as a theoretical lens to explore how organizations use cloud computing to achieve dynamic capabilities. First, the framework allows us to analyze organization-level mechanisms as well as activity-level behavior that constitute an organization’s responsiveness for achieving dynamic capabilities. Second, the four business design principles that are suggested in the framework help conceptualize the adaptive practices used by organizations to achieve dynamic capabilities. Third, past research has successfully used this framework to examine how organizations may achieve dynamic capabilities. For example, prior studies (Mathiassen & Vainio, 2007; Schmidt & Mathiassen, 2009) examine how small software ﬁrms improve their performance when operating in dynamic business environments by using the four business design principles for integrating activity and ﬁrmlevel capabilities. A recent study uses this framework to examine how an organization may bridge the gap between what it senses from the environment and its response (Nalchigar & Yu, 2013), and proposes a methodology for closing the sense-and-respond loop with business intelligence technologies. The sense-and-respond framework has also been used to measure an organization’s market-scanning capability in a dynamic business environment (Alam et al, 2013). Because the send-and-respond framework has been successfully used in varied contexts in which organizations exhibit dynamic capabilities, it is an appropriate theoretical lens for our study.

dynamic capabilities include extensive and frequent use of prototyping to obtain feedback, and the use of real-time information to alert participants about the need to adjust actions (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). Dynamic capabilities help ﬁrms achieve as well as sustain competitive advantage by using ‘existing internal and external ﬁrm-speciﬁc competences to address changing environments’ (Teece et al, 1997, p. 510). Speciﬁcally, these capabilities help respond to rapid change in technology and market forces. These dynamic capabilities align well with cloud computing, which provides IT resources that can be rapidly conﬁgured to help an organization respond to market dynamics (Narasimhan & Nichols, 2011a). According to Teece (2007), in many industries, scalability is a signiﬁcant enabler of dynamic capability. In fact, a major advantage of cloud computing is the ability to scale resources up and down, reduce costs, react quickly, and provide services to customers (Narasimhan & Nichols, 2011a). Thus, cloud computing as an IT resource possesses several characteristics that make it an excellent candidate to enable dynamic capabilities; hence, it is the focus of our study. Moreover, the four processes suggested by Haeckel (1999) for achieving dynamic capabilities seem to map well to the capabilities of cloud computing reported in the literature. First, cloud computing may enable organizations to commit their resources dynamically according to business needs and provide on-demand access to conﬁgurable IT resources. This is feasible owing to several characteristics of cloud computing, including dynamic discovery and the ability to bring together IT resources based on current needs. Major cloud service providers such Amazon Web Services exemplify such abilities. Second, the architecture of cloud computing is modular, which may enable organizations to design modular processes. The architectural modularity may facilitate the integration and coordination of processes and applications. Interoperability of cloud computing is facilitated by an intermediary layer and sharing of the same standards for coordination and communication (Bernstein et al, 2009; Dillon et al, 2010). Cloud computing with dynamic discovery and conﬁgurability may help organizations identify and compose relevant services to create customized solutions (Weiss, 2007; Buyya et al, 2008). Third, cloud computing enables organizations to collect, analyze, and generate ideas and recommendations from a variety of data sources such as social media and data repositories in their business networks (Chan, 2012), thereby enhancing learning capabilities. Fourth, because cloud services often use a pay-as-you-go model, it offers the ability to embed value-based governance and accountability (Singh et al, 2011).

Cloud computing and dynamic capabilities Dynamic capabilities theory suggests that simple rules are needed rather than complicated heavyweight routines. Indeed, cloud computing enables the use of simpler processes rather than ‘heavyweight’ processes for developing and delivering products and services (Narasimhan & Nichols, 2011b). In high-velocity environments, effective

them to effectively reconﬁgure existing operational capabilities to match the changing business needs. These changes may be trigged by either external (e.g., customer needs, competitors’ strategies) or internal (e.g., development of new products, internal crises) enterprise environments (Zahra & George, 2002). In his seminal article, Venkatraman (1994) suggests that emerging business environments call for strategies that achieve multiple objectives: low cost, high quality, and fast and ﬂexible response to customer needs. Further, he suggests that none of them in isolation is sufﬁcient for achieving competitive success. On the basis of the analysis of IT capabilities in a large number of organizations, he identiﬁes ﬁve groups of processes and classiﬁes them along two dimensions: the range of IT’s potential beneﬁts and the degree of organizational transformation. On the basis of the scope of changes, he further identiﬁes two levels of IT-enabled business changes: evolutionary and revolutionary. Arguing that the value of implementing IT given current organizational ‘strategies, structures, processes, and culture’ is minimal, he advocates the use of IT to enable the transformation of organizational strategies, processes, and so on. Five groups of changes (localized exploitation, internal integration, business process redesign, business network redesign, and business scope redeﬁnition) identiﬁed in his research have been categorized into two groups based on the degree of changes and the range of potential beneﬁts. The ﬁrst two groups (localized exploitation and internal integration) offer low-level changes as well as beneﬁts. These largely correspond to improvements in functional competencies (the ability to effectively execute operational processes) (Pavlou & El Sawy, 2006). While localized exploitation results in isolated systems that are fragmented across particular operational units, internal integration attempts to address challenges posed by such fragmentation by integrating the technologies involved and the business processes to be fulﬁlled. In contrast, the next three levels (business process redesign, business network redesign, and business scope redeﬁnition) correspond to dynamic capabilities (i.e., the ability to reconﬁgure functional competencies to address turbulent environments) and may be termed transformational changes. Venkatraman (1994) also recognizes that these higher levels may be necessary, ‘depending on competitive pressures and the need to deliver greater value than competitors in the marketplace’ (p. 74). Business process redesign attempts to question the rationale for existing business processes. Business network redesign focuses on relationships across organizations and attempts to redesign ‘exchange among participants in the business network’ (Venkatraman, 1994). At the far end of the spectrum, the current scope of the business should be questioned and the role of IT in expanding this scope should be examined. A recent review of literature (Besson & Rowe, 2012) notes that Venkatraman’s (1994) IT-enabled business transformation framework has been widely used to study

the critical role of IT in enabling organizational transformation. Cordella & Iannacci (2010) use it to study the relationship between new technologies in information systems and e-government reforms. Lee (2012) uses it to develop an explanation of how organizations achieve business agility from information technology. Wamba & Chatﬁeld (2009) use the framework to examine the key contingency factors that impact the inﬂuence of RFID technology in supply chain projects. Because our study seeks to understand how organizations achieve dynamic capabilities by using cloud computing, it examines the role of the cloud-computing-enabled transformations that are necessary to achieve dynamic capabilities.

Research methodology
To answer our research question, we conducted a ﬁeld study using a multiple-case study design (Yin, 2003), where the units of analysis are individual organizations that provide and consume cloud computing services. We conducted an exploratory multiple-case study to answer our research question because this area of research is relatively uncharted (Yin, 2003). Despite the growing literature on cloud computing, there is a lack of a systematic framework to understand how cloud computing can help organizations achieve dynamic capabilities, and this motivates the choice of our research methodology to inductively develop a framework (Eisenhardt, 1989). Qualitative methods can help us gain insights into the complexity involved in using cloud computing to achieve dynamic capabilities, and facilitate the development of richer and more informative conclusions (Alavi & Carlson, 1992; Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2001). Yin (2003) deﬁnes a case study as ‘an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident’. Empirical investigation of cloud computing-enabled dynamic capabilities aligns well with this view. Case study research is useful when ‘a phenomenon is broad and complex, where the existing body of knowledge is insufﬁcient to permit the posing of causal questions, when a holistic, in-depth investigation is needed, and when a phenomenon cannot be studied outside the context in which it occurs’ (Paré, 2004). Our examination of cloud computing-enabled capabilities is consistent with these deﬁnitions of the case study method. Our qualitative study follows the positivistic tradition that is similar to the approach used by Levina & Ross (2003). We clarify that positivistic case studies can be descriptive, exploratory, or explanatory (Myers, 1997). Our study is exploratory in that it focuses on inductive theory building. As Levina & Ross (2003) observe when using this ‘a formal, positivistic theory’ may be used to explain some of the ﬁndings. In our study, the sense-andrespond approach to achieving dynamic capabilities used for this purpose. We also follow the steps that Eisenhardt (1989) outlines for building a theory that is grounded in the data collected. Following Eisenhardt (1989) and Dubé

Douglas A. Battleson et al

& Paré (2003, p. 605), we also acknowledge that exploratory case studies may be aimed at ‘deﬁning questions, proposing new constructs, and/or building new theories’. Because no existing theory could adequately answer our research question, our research did not start with any speciﬁc hypotheses that could be tested. In fact, according to Eisenhardt (1989), such an approach is very appropriate for an exploratory study such as ours. We subscribe to Paré’s (2004) view that using elements of prior theory might be of ‘great help in focusing research efforts at the outset of the project’. Therefore, our study uses seed concepts from the literature on dynamic capabilities (the four sense-and-respond strategies) and (the three types of) IT-enabled dynamic business process transformation, which provide the initial framing that is necessary for developing an understanding of how organizations achieve dynamic capabilities by using cloud computing. Following well-established guidelines for conducting exploratory case studies (Eisenhardt, 1989; Dubé & Paré, 2003, pp. 607), we recognize that ‘although early identiﬁcation of possible constructs can be helpful’, these are ‘tentative’ because of the theory-building nature of our research.

organizations that were facing dynamic markets in which customer needs were changing signiﬁcantly and rapidly, and had reportedly identiﬁed cloud computing as an important component of their IT strategy. Senior executives from these organizations who had rich positive and negative experiences pertaining to the use of cloud computing were identiﬁed as subjects for our study. The selection of our multiple-case study sites is consistent with the notion of ‘information-oriented selection’ to maximize the utility of information from a small sample (Flyvbjerg, 2006). Senior personnel representing different perspectives within each organization helped us replicate our ﬁndings, thereby strengthening the potential for generalizability (Eisenhardt, 1989; Miles & Huberman, 1994; Yin, 2003). However, the primary rationale underlying our selection of the study sites was their potential to provide a rich context to understand and develop insights into the use of cloud computing to achieve dynamic capabilities rather than them serving as representative organizations from which to generalize our ﬁndings.

Site selection We used theoretical sampling (Patton, 1990) to select senior executives who were responsible for making critical decisions related to the adoption and use of cloud computing in 14 organizations. We conducted a ﬁeld study with a multiple-case study design (de Corbiere & Rowe, 2013) because it can enhance the generalizability of our ﬁndings (Huberman & Miles, 2002). Multiple cases, adequately sampled and carefully analyzed, can enhance the relevance or applicability of our ﬁndings. In addition, a multiple-case study can enhance our understanding and explanation of a focal issue (Yin, 2003). Speciﬁcally, we sought informants who possess signiﬁcant experience and insights on cloud computing-enabled transformation of business processes in their respective organizations. Twenty-eight different informants drawn from ten private sector and four public sector organizations participated in the study. The selection of our multiple-case study sites was driven by purposeful, theoretical sampling (Yin, 2003; Glaser & Strauss, 2009), that is, the potential to investigate the use of cloud computing to achieve dynamic capabilities. The sites offered a theoretically relevant organizational context because many of them were pioneering the use of cloud computing in innovative ways. They also offered opportunities for disconﬁrming our expectations that the organization will be able to successfully use cloud computing to achieve dynamic capabilities because of the novelty and uncertainties involved in the technology (Markus, 1989; Dubé & Paré, 2003). We sought the perspectives of executives from both private and public sector organizations because cloud computing is gaining wide acceptance in both types of organizations. Speciﬁcally, we selected

Data collection Data was collected through semi-structured interviews of one or more respondents in each organization. Data collection and analysis were conducted progressively in an iterative fashion. We also used snowball sampling in that we initially identiﬁed key contact persons (such as the Chief Information Ofﬁcer) in the organizations, discussed our research objectives with them, and sought their help in identifying additional participants for the study. Our interviews centered on cloud computing implementations that had already occurred or were in progress. The semi-structured interviews lasted approximately 1 h each. All but three interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. While three interviews could not be recorded because the informants had not received the necessary approval for recording, detailed notes were taken and clariﬁcations were obtained from the informants. In fact, detailed notes were taken during all the interviews. The transcripts of the interviews and notes were coded using NVivo (Bazeley & Jackson, 2013). An initial coding scheme was developed based on a review of the literature and it was modiﬁed on the basis of data analysis (Charmaz, 2006). The four sense-and-respond strategies and the three types of IT-enabled business transformations were used as initial codes. The concepts that emerged from our data include the plausible relationships among these constructs as well as the environmental turbulence, different dimensions of performance, and factors that foster and hinder the development of dynamic capabilities. Data collection and analysis were undertaken until ‘theoretical saturation’ (Eisenhardt, 1989) was reached, wherein further data provided no new insights. Details about our informants are summarized in Table 1. We also evaluated the level of cloud computing adoption and maturity, as shown in the last column of Table 1. We reviewed several frameworks that have been proposed to evaluate the maturity of cloud

computing adoption in government and private organizations (Mattoon et al, 2011; Jung et al, 2013; Knickle et al, 2013; Trivedi, 2013; Unicom, 2013). We selected the cloud computing adoption and maturity model proposed by Trivedi (2013) as the most appropriate to evaluate the level of adoption of cloud computing in each of the organizations. The study included organizations that are at higher levels of maturity (Levels 4 and 5) because they are the most likely candidates for the transformational use of cloud computing. We include our assessment of cloud adoption for each of the organizations in Table 1. Follow-up discussions with our informants helped us seek clariﬁcations and obtain additional insights. We present evidence through quotes from the qualitative data collected in accordance with recommended practices in qualitative research studies (Mason, 2002). Each quote also identiﬁes the organization and the role of the respondent (see Table 1).

Data analysis Initially, we coded the interview data with the seed concepts drawn from our review of the literature. New concepts (e.g., employee empowerment, maturity of IT infrastructure, IS governance) that emerged from our analysis relate to plausible relationships among constructs as well as the environmental turbulence, different dimensions of performance, and factors that foster and hinder the development of dynamic capabilities. The new concepts enriched our analysis, as they constitute

microfoundations of dynamic capabilities. Text fragments from the interview transcripts were tagged with one or more codes along with justiﬁcations for the selection of codes. Finally, key themes were identiﬁed based on the codes that emerged (Patton, 1990), which were then synthesized into the conceptual framework. The authors analyzed the data independently and then combined their analyses by resolving discrepancies between each other’s entries through discussion, referencing the interview reports, and consulting with another author (inter-rater agreement – κ = 0.93). The evidence was then summarized and entered into a matrix created for the purpose of qualitative data analysis (see Table 2 for an excerpt). For each interview, the authors recorded the type of evidence, the information captured, and examples. Our study included a mix of both public and private sector organizations that were engaged in major cloud computing initiatives. There were no critical differences in our ﬁndings between these two groups, and any signiﬁcant differences between the two that emerged during our analysis are presented in our ﬁndings. A major reason for the lack of differences is that many government and private organizations used services provided by some of the same cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google, VMWare, and Salesforce. While some organizations did use services that are unique to their settings (e.g., government agencies providing cloud computing services only to other government agencies), these services were quite similar to those provided by major

commercial cloud providers. In addition, all the organizations were at high levels of maturity in their adoption of cloud computing. Thus, there were signiﬁcant similarities in the nature of the services used by the organizations studied. The data analysis process helped us establish the consistency and plausibility of the concepts, constructs, subcategories, and relationships that emerged and ensured that our conceptual framework satisﬁed established criteria for the credibility and validity of qualitative research (Miles & Huberman, 1994; Pawlowski & Robey, 2004). We made no attempt to statistically evaluate the strength of concepts in the framework (Strauss & Corbin, 1990); theoretical relevance of the concepts was established by their repeated presence or notable absence (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). While ﬁndings from such analyses may be ‘detailed and particularistic’, they can be used to develop general explanations (Eisenhardt, 1989;

Orlikowski, 1993) through analytic generalization (Yin, 2003). Minor adjustments were made to the terminology used and the framework based on further feedback from research participants.

Findings
Our framework Figure 1 shows the framework that we have developed based on the analysis of our data. We observe that organizations experience market dynamism characterized by the dynamic nature of product and service needs of their current and potential customers. They respond to this market dynamism by developing dynamic capabilities. Speciﬁcally, they use the following four sense-and-respond strategies: dynamic commitment of resources, designing modular processes, designing processes that help learn about their environment,

customers, and operations, and designing context-speciﬁc governance mechanisms. These four strategies, enabled by cloud computing, help shape three levels of business process transformation (namely, business process redesign, business network redesign, and business scope redeﬁnition). These transformations, in turn, lead to positive outcomes in organizational performance: effectiveness (quality and innovativeness) and efﬁciency (time and cost). In addition, the framework identiﬁes two groups of factors (organizational factors and characteristics of cloud computing) that foster the development of dynamic capabilities. It also includes factors that hinder the development of dynamic capabilities using cloud computing. Below, we describe the framework in detail.

provides its customers with the ability to conﬁgure solutions to the unique and often changing needs (10, CTO). He further states that the cloud-based deployment strategy has helped them understand the needs of current and potential customers and reconﬁgure our product platform in very different ways and acquire new customers very rapidly (10, CTO). Below, we discuss how cloud computing enabled the four sense-and-respond strategies.

Market dynamism Rapidly changing needs for products and services in the markets in which organizations operate shaped the responses observed in the focal organizations. The dynamic nature of current and potential customer needs, in turn, requires organizations to develop dynamic capabilities. These capabilities may be enabled by technology infrastructure (both hardware and software) that supports the business processes used by the organizations. A senior IT executive in the hospitality industry explains this challenge as follows: We operate in a market where the customer expectations change dramatically depending on a variety of factors like location, season, competitive offerings, local events. We were not only looking for solutions that could help us rapidly develop new capabilities and deliver them to our various customer centric process owners, but we also have to do this in a cost-effective and rapid manner (11, Senior Manager). The nature of the rapidly changing business landscape was highlighted by the COO of a ﬁnancial services organization as follows: We are facing competitive pressures from all sides and the regulatory environment. Our business models had to change dramatically in recent years just to be able to survive in this climate (14, COO). The focal organizations responded to market dynamism, which presented both challenges and opportunities, and developed dynamic capabilities with the use of sense-and-respond strategies. Sense-and-respond strategies Our analysis identiﬁed the following four groups of senseand-respond strategies used by the many focal organizations: dynamic commitment of organizational resources (both IT and non-IT resources), designing processes in a modular fashion such that they can be easily reconﬁgured to provide novel and customized functionalities, designing IT-enabled organizational processes that help learn about their environment, customers, and business processes, and designing context-speciﬁc governance mechanisms that enable ﬂexible use of IT resources. For example, a CTO of an enterprise software development organization explains how the cloud computing platform

Dynamic commitment of resources To be adaptive, organizations must dynamically commit IT resources to develop products and services that are tailored to meet the unique needs of each customer. First, cloud computing allows organizations to scale up or down their IT infrastructure with ease because they can gain on-demand access to conﬁgurable IT resources. The CIO of a sales and distribution company explains how cloud computing provides this capability, which could not be developed with traditional IT infrastructure: We needed the capability to quickly exploit new opportunities offered by the ever changing marketplace. We changed our order management system with a cloud solution that offers capabilities well beyond what we could do internally. Since our business is very seasonal, it is important for us to scale our IT capabilities up and down radically to take advantage of emerging opportunities and keep the cost of our IT investments low (12, CIO). A technology executive at a consulting organization explains how such an ability to dynamically reconﬁgure IT resources that was simply infeasible before moving to cloud computing has helped reshape their business and improve their responsiveness to customer needs. The CIO of a major public sector organization concurs with this assessment and states that in the past, there wasn’t any on-demand resource that was available with rapid real-time provisioning like we have today. We know exactly what it costs and we could scale it as it grows [instead of] guessing what the demand was going to be and you would budget for it ahead of time (2, CIO). She further explained how cloud computing enables the dynamic commitment of even non-IT resources (more speciﬁcally, their physical ofﬁce space) as well: We will have 4000 people moving into the building. The building itself only has seating for about 2000 people. Cloud-based tools are going to really be critical for us to pull this off so that they can do their work from anywhere, anytime (2, CIO). This ability to dynamically reconﬁgure non-IT resources with the use of cloud computing was echoed by an executive with a ﬁeld service organization. Finally, a VP of a private sector infrastructure provider elaborates on the agility and ﬂexibility provided by cloud computing that helps them dynamically add resources as well as reallocate them to other users when they are no longer needed. In addition, such dynamic commitment drastically reduces the costs of these resources for the user: The cloud environment in general is intended to be quite agile and ﬂexible and adaptable, and [unneeded] infrastructure resources can fairly easily, from an elasticity standpoint, be pushed back into the pool and be grabbed by another user that has a need. Also, it dramatically

improves the economics of my operations (3, VP). Thus, cloud computing enables organizations to dynamically commit both IT and non-IT resources depending on the dynamic needs of market.

Designing modular processes Modular design allows organizations to rapidly create or modify their products and services by reconﬁguring their operational capabilities. Modular design also allows organizations to transcend organizational boundaries by synergistically exploiting interconnections with external entities such as suppliers, intermediaries, and customers. By redesigning their business processes and integrating them with those used by their partner organizations, organizations were able to offer new products and services as well as serve new customers. The CIO of a very large public sector organization explains the beneﬁts from the ability to perform modular development and deployment of IT services on a cloud-based infrastructure: Cloud is one of several complimentary technologies that together create an ability to do modular and incremental development. Cloud computing plus open standards, open rapid development technologies, the whole web services concept, the browser or the mobile interface or application platform. All of those together make it easy to develop and deploy IT services in a rapid way (2, CIO). A VP of a private sector infrastructure provider notes that cloud computing enables the development of modular capabilities by allowing applications to present themselves and access other applications on the Web. According to the CTO of a consulting organization, signiﬁcant beneﬁts of modular processes enabled by cloud computing include the ability to rapidly develop prototypes, obtain feedback from executives and customers, and rapidly modify them based on the feedback. An executive with a retailer emphasizes that such a capability could not be developed without cloud enablement: We just didn’t have the resources to develop the wide variety of service components that are readily and inexpensively available on the cloud platform. Also, cloud makes it possible for our processes to interoperate with our customers (12, CIO). Thus, information systems that consist of modular and conﬁgurable processes supported by cloud computing help organizations integrate both internal and external processes so that they are aligned with their evolving needs. In addition, cloud computing increases interoperability of their systems and processes by adhering to common standards and protocols. Cloud computing, along with dynamic discovery and conﬁgurability, helps organizations identify and compose relevant services to match market changes and create customized solutions. Modular design also facilitates rapid reconﬁguring of business processes to meet the needs of different client segments whose needs are also emergent. However, such reconﬁgurations may be constrained by the initial conceptualization of the system that was modularized. According to the CIO of a sales and distribution organization, these capabilities cannot be developed internally for both technical and economic reasons. Our cloud-based order

management system helps me pick and choose the components I need for each kind of market segment and create customized sales order processes for them … Our cloud solution lets each group pick processes that are unique to their needs. This is possible because of the modular design of the cloud-based solution and it supports a large number of possible variations of this process. We just couldn’t do it internally because developing such a platform is neither technically nor economically feasible for any single organization. Shared services and a pay-as-you-go model make it viable (12, CIO). Organizations should pursue modular design approach based on standardization carefully as they may encounter unexpected challenges such as the inability to customize processes that meet their unique needs. A manager at a large public organization expresses his concern over standardization while suggesting localized development as a solution. Localized development gives people the custom look and feel and features that they need at their work group level (1, Manager). A VP of a cloud computing company cautions that organizations should be prepared for changes as a result of modularization based on standards. If you are committed to [cloud based] solutions, but you are migrating all of your core processes … If you are migrating all of those over to a completely different model – business model – you have got, to some degree, business process reengineering to do (3, VP). Our results suggest that because each layer of cloud computing architecture is loosely coupled, each layer can evolve separately. Such architectural modularity allows cloud computing to support the development of modular applications that can be easily integrated and coordinated to meet a wide range of requirements while reducing management and maintenance overhead.

Designing processes that help learn This sense-andrespond strategy involves creating processes that help organizations learn about their environment, customers, and business processes so that they can respond to changes. Many focal organizations achieved this capability by enabling individuals or organizational units to gather, process, and analyze relevant information cues so that they can effectively recognize opportunities for offering new products and services as well as respond to competitive threats. The director of sales for a ﬁeld service organization acknowledges that a cloud-based platform enables his organization to learn about its customers’ evolving needs very quickly. In addition to the capability to collect information, the ability to analyze the information in innovative ways using cloud-based advanced analytics services was highlighted by an executive of a mid-sized retailer. Further, they have access to capabilities that were infeasible to develop internally for technical and economic reasons: Cloud analytics has helped us use the same sophisticated algorithms that used to be accessible to only very large organizations. It is not lightweight analytics that we need to settle for if we do this in-house. We have access to a variety of tools – from simple to very sophisticated – and pay for them when we use them. There is no need for us to invest in expensive

tools and personnel (13, CMO). She further mentions that such an ability to collect data about the behaviors of customers and analyzing this information (if necessary, in real time) helps the organization rapidly respond to evolving customer needs. The CIO of a public organization explains the use of cloud-based social media platforms and the use of a cloud-based analytics solution for a similar purpose: [Our social media] platforms are all cloud based. You can start to track what your customers are saying about you, you can start to respond to them, you can start to build a brand online in a way that targets the customer categories in a very focused manner. So I think cloud computing is sort of an enabler (3, VP). Thus, cloud computing provides organizations with the ability to learn sophisticated patterns underlying the data on the environment, customers, and business processes and thus make decisions that address their dynamic needs.

business scope redeﬁnition) that provided dynamic capabilities to the focal organizations.

Designing context-speciﬁc governance mechanisms IT governance involves establishing decision rights and accountability to ensure that IT investments result in the creation of business value. In many focal organizations, cloud computing enables the dispersion of decision rights across the entire organization. The CIO of a major public sector organization says, With a credit card that has a low purchase threshold, you could stand up a cloud service on a very modest level (2, CIO). A VP of a private sector infrastructure provider further explains how the cloud computing environment provides opportunities for creating an adaptive organization through appropriate governance processes: With self-service, we signiﬁcantly lower the barriers to resource creation and consumption. Our staff is much more efﬁcient in their use of resources because they had to make optimization decisions. We put into the workﬂow tool a check against whether a person had budget authority (3, VP). According to an executive in the hospitality industry, his organization was able to empower its employees by providing them the ability to create and modify business processes. However, senior management had the ability to monitor and control their actions so that these were in alignment with organizational goals. Thus, the development of context-speciﬁc cloudcomputing-enabled governance mechanisms helped organizations distribute and maintain control over decision rights. This helps create an atmosphere of learning and strategic thinking throughout the organization, while also providing adequate control over the actions taken by organizational members at different hierarchical levels.

Cloud-computing-enabled transformations The above-mentioned four principles of adaptive enterprise design with the use of sense-and-response strategies shaped three levels of business process transformations (business process redesign, business network redesign, and

Business process redesign Cloud computing can not only simply support existing business processes but also help redesign them in order to achieve a wider range of beneﬁts and higher levels of organizational transformation. The Associate CIO of a public sector organization suggests that their inspection of their critical business processes have really evolved rapidly due to the capabilities provided by the cloud platform … These [processes] went to more risk-based inspection and then moving into … more predictive analytics and it is just a greater maturation of the inspections (1, Associate CIO). He also acknowledges signiﬁcant changes in business processes used by IT department. [cloud computing] signiﬁcantly changed the business processes within the IT (1, Associate CIO). A VP of a private sector infrastructure provider recognizes that more organizations are achieving business process redesign enabled by cloud computing. When organizations are leveraging the Cloud to redesign business process, it is a pretty mature use of the Cloud. [And this] transform[s] how the mission is being carried out (3, VP). A CIO further recognizes how signiﬁcant changes in business processes could be facilitated by moving to the cloud environment: For business and programming executives, it is important to think about how their business proﬁts and their business models can be enhanced or even transformed by the capabilities that the Cloud provides and we are going to save tens of millions of dollars by making this move (2, CIO). The CIO of a sales and distribution company emphasized that while business process transformations may be achieved by modifying internal systems, the cloud platform provides several unique features that cannot be easily and economically developed internally. We dramatically redesigned our sales and distribution processes and we are able to do it on the ﬂy in many cases. Could we do it internally, say, with an ERP or a homegrown system? Deﬁnitely not. First, it is very expensive and takes months of implementation, by which time our needs may be different. Also, the cloud provider gives us access to best of breed conﬁgurable platform, which we can use to create numerous variations of the sales order process. And these can change dynamically (13, CMO). The ability to learn about critical aspects of the operations that are facilitated by cloud-based analytics and the ability to combine modular processes were cited as critical drivers of business process redesign by an executive of a major manufacturer. Finally, the CTO of a public sector organization that provides IT infrastructure services to its customers states how his organization has been able to radically change (and almost fully automate) its business processes for provisioning software to its customers. From the software as a service perspective that we implemented on top of our IaaS, we enabled that capability so that we have been able to provide all these services via the web. It is kind of fully automated (9, CTO). Thus, the ability to learn about customers, the environment, and operations, as well as the ability to dynamically integrate modular processes that are provided

by cloud computing, enables organizations to dramatically redesign their business processes.

Business network redesign Organizations have managed to redesign the nature of exchange and relationships among multiple participants in their business network with the use of cloud computing. By redesigning business processes that are shared by multiple business partners, organizations can realize beneﬁts well beyond those that are provided by simply automating internal business processes. By restructuring the relationships in their business network, some organizations have managed to leverage competencies possessed by partner organizations. A technology executive with a consulting organization explained how the ability to leverage the analytics services provided by a partner organization helps their client organization signiﬁcantly reduce costs and increase the ability to quickly acquire new capabilities: Our new business intelligence reporting initiative, an initiative that leverages some external web services, [required a] dedicated environment to test these things. If we had to acquire hardware in order to do it, [costs] would have been high. Because our development environment exists in our private cloud, it allows us to try new things [such as analytics capability provided by a partner organization] much more effectively (5, Chief Scientist). A VP of a private sector infrastructure provider notes that one of their customers is leveraging the cloud to redeﬁne their relationships with other organizations as well as their customers. This ability to seamlessly collaborate to carry out shared business processes is essentially changing the relationship in leveraging the new Cloud-based platform, in this case the social media type of platform. And so, I would consider that to be kind of restructuring of the relationships (3, VP). The CIO of a public sector organization states that the cloud computing platform enables efﬁcient coordination among multiple agencies involved in business processes. It is just a shared workspace that is available from any place, any time, and they can collaborate in real time and have an audit trail of the work that was done (2, CIO). The ability to transform business operations by creating dynamic alliances with their suppliers and customers by participating in a common cloud platform was highlighted by an executive of an enterprise software development ﬁrm. He also argues that this capability cannot be developed internally because such networks do not provide the same level of ﬂexibility to create and modify linkages. Thus, cloud computing enable organizations to redesign their business network by helping them discover the opportunities for creating linkages as well as provide the ability to integrate modular processes dynamically across organizations that are part of their business network. Further, the elasticity provided by cloud computing enables the rapid redeﬁnition of such networks depending on the needs shaped by a turbulent environment. Business scope redeﬁnition This level of transformation is concerned with the speciﬁc role played by cloud

computing in inﬂuencing the scope of activities that organizations are pursuing. By enabling organizations to change the ‘rules of the game’ in the marketplace, cloud computing provides the ability to attract new customers and create new products and services in their security consulting practice, explains a technology executive with a consulting organization. The ability to exploit organizational data in unique and interesting ways is another example of business scope redeﬁnition, explains the CTO of a public sector organization: [Cloud is] not just infrastructure platform and software. Data as a Service, Storage as a Service, all this ‘as a Service’ is to me the paradigm shift from owning your infrastructure (7, CTO). The CTO of a public sector organization echoes how the cloud platform has enabled him to create new products and services within our IT organizations, such as authentication services (9, CTO). The VP of a private sector infrastructure provider discusses an example of a rapidly created application that enables the redeﬁnition of the scope of business in the context of property appraisals. This startup company used this [cloud-based development] model to develop an application for the appraisers to use a smart phone to enter their data and pictures to create the case ﬁle, and this application was developed for $12,000 in a couple of weeks (3, VP). In essence, a combination of technologies that rely on cloud computing offers opportunities for radically redeﬁning the scope of businesses, elaborates this executive. The use of cloud-based analytical capabilities has enabled an organization to dramatically alter the product mix offered in key market segments and thus gain competitive advantage. Our analytics guided us to radically rethink our product and services and take advantage of an enormous opportunity we would have missed otherwise. We could also execute immediately because we could put together the processes needed for addressing this emerging need on the cloud platform. I truly believe that this is a big game changer for us and in fact critical for us to thrive in the long term (11, Sr. Manager). The CTO of a ﬁnancial institution explains that cloud enablement of a few key processes has helped his institution dramatically change the way it interacts with its customers and the nature of its business model. He further explains how cloud computing was a signiﬁcant contributor in its business transformation. A service manager mentions that cloud computing enables his organization to introduce a new mobile computing service. So the cloud has deﬁnitely helped us because it has moved us in that direction, and then [the cloud provider] has now come out with and iPad app so it has deﬁnitely made mobile computing a lot easier for us (6, Service Manager). Finally, the CTO of a federal department explains how cloud computing enables his organization to deliver services with agility. That is really what I can provide, business agility. [The client] asked us to provide the service in one month. Actually, we did it in less than a month. That to me is not just providing the business agility internally but we can also provide business agility to the customer (9, CTO). Thus, organizations have been able to create new products and services, and dramatically alter the scope of their businesses by the capabilities provided by cloud

computing to learn, integrate modular processes, and respond dynamically. In summary, the business process transformations achieved by organizations with the use of sense-andrespond strategies have helped them respond to environmental turbulence.

Supporting factors The ability to develop dynamic capabilities discussed above was fostered by several organizational factors as well as the essential characteristics of cloud computing technology. Organizational factors Organizational factors supporting the development of dynamic capabilities using cloud computing include mature governance of IS, employee empowerment, and the maturity of IT infrastructure. First, a mature governance mechanism that has been designed to support cloud computing enables organizations to be adaptive in dynamic market. Speciﬁcally, with appropriate governance mechanisms to address issues such as data protection, security control, and compliance with organizational standards, cloud computing helps organizations monitor and enforce controls over critical processes. The ability of the monitor, to shut these things down, and then potentially rapidly stand them up again as the need arises, these offers environment where these things could happen but the business decisions associated with it, the processes need to mature in order to properly balance this speed with which something is set up so it is not instantaneous, explains a marketing analyst at a manufacturing and construction organization (6, Marketing Analyst). Mature governance mechanisms also help organizations respond rapidly while maintaining the integrity of organizational processes. Governance of the security process can change fairly substantially too because in order to carry out an automated process in … minutes (3, VP), states the VP of a major cloud vendor. A cloud computing expert emphasizes that cost savings from cloud computing cannot be guaranteed without mature governance. In the absence of those (mature) governance models …, the cost savings factor is not consistent with what has been advertised (8, Cloud Computing Expert). Second, the empowerment of employees throughout the organization to create and modify business processes that meet the current and evolving needs of the customers was considered essential for the success of their cloud computing strategy by an executive at a retailer: We have empowered many of our employees to redesign processes if they can better meet the needs of the marketplace. They are the ones who are dealing directly with the customers and have a better understanding of what works best (13, CMO). Third, mature IT infrastructure enables organizations to embrace cloud computing more readily. A large public organization was able to leverage capabilities of the cloud platform quickly because they had developed internal systems that used many of the technologies that were part of the cloud platform: To bring our top level domain into the

cloud, …. we are leveraging Infrastructure as a Service vendor as well as Software as a Service vendor to make that happen in an open source Drupal platform manner. We had used these technologies in internal projects (7, CTO). A chief scientist at a consulting company acknowledges that a mature IT infrastructure is an enabler. Standing up and maintaining that diverse ecosystem on physical infrastructure was a daunting challenge … since we had a well-developed infrastructure we were able to pull it off (5, Chief Scientist).

Characteristics of cloud computing The following ﬁve essential characteristics of cloud computing support organizations develop dynamic capabilities: on-demand selfservice, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. First, the ability to provide on-demand self-service helps organizations automatically use IT resources as and when needed without requiring human interaction with service providers. As you move from the hardware being virtualized and other resources, infrastructure resources being abstracted away from view … you get to a point where that [IS resources] becomes highly automated and highly orchestrated (5, CTO). Second, cloud computing provides broad network access through standard mechanisms thereby enabling organizations to access resources across multiple platforms. Broad access also facilitates rapid scaling up and down of IT resources in response to market dynamism. The fact that it is not here, it is out there and we access these resources remotely (1, Manager). I can immediately add more servers or take them down if market conditions change (13, CTO). Third, the resource pooling feature of cloud computing enables organizations to pool computing resources and dynamically assign and reassign them according to their needs. So by having a shared pooling resources …. [the government] agency … can respond quickly (2, Director). Fourth, a rapid elasticity feature of cloud computing enables organizations to rapidly change provisioned IT resources. Organizations can easily acquire IT resources in varying quantities even for very short periods of time, rather than committing to long term investments in them. We are seeing much greater agility and elasticity …., so people are able to scale up and scale down much more rapidly than they were before (4, Regional Director). Fifth, since cloud computing provides measured service, organizations can carefully monitor, control and optimize the amount of resources that are used to support organizational processes. We are able to carefully look at our spending on IT, how best to buy services when the demand for these services change. We are able to easily ﬁgure out how much it costs to support processes and establish priorities in meeting the needs of different markets (12, Director). Challenging factors It should be noted that several potential challenges to achieving dynamic capabilities posed by cloud computing were also observed in the focal organizations. We discuss how these challenges were addressed in the studied organizations.

Achieving dynamic capabilities with cloud computing

Douglas A. Battleson et al

First, security and privacy are signiﬁcant concerns because cloud computing increases the number of people with potential access to sensitive information. Many focal organizations expressed concern with storing sensitive data on the cloud. Even though using large and reliable cloud computing vendors can, in fact, improve security for small organizations, data security is a major concern if critical data is in the hands of the cloud provider. For our citizen-facing application, it was [a] challenge of delivering a secure application containing privacy data with a footprint that extends nationwide (5, Chief Scientist). A similar concern was shared by another senior executive due to the integrated nature of systems they had to use in a cloud computing environment: All of the systems are integrated ... but the negative part is again all of the security risks and especially privacy could also be an issue (1, CISO). The potential economic damage resulting from security breaches in a cloud environment can be so catastrophic that many organizations are reluctant to adopt and integrate cloud computing with their IT infrastructure. This challenge was addressed by some focal organizations by developing processes for security and privacy monitoring. A VP at a focal organization suggested a substantial revision of security policies: Governance of the security process can change fairly substantially too because in order to carry out an automated process in a number of minutes or hours you can’t have manual security steps or intervention required. So you have to think of ways to automate the security control points and have baselines of security approvals that are automated so you can monitor the environment in a more automated fashion so you can carry out faster delivery times (3, VP). In addition, evaluating and selecting cloud computing providers with adequate expertise in delivering required levels of security was recommended. Security can be done well on the cloud and security can be done poorly in the cloud; the question is whether the service provider has enough security expertise (3, VP). This would require investments in infrastructure as well expertise so that the organization can develop adequate understanding of security needs and capabilities. Some of the risks associated with public cloud and hybrid offerings require a greater understanding of security and more security-conscious solutions. Now, I would say that that’s not a direct negative, it’s a function of new opportunities being offered through these systems (5, Chief Scientist). The adoption of security certiﬁcations such as the Federal Risk and Authorization Program (FedRAMP) can help organizations evaluate and monitor the level of security provided by cloud computing. Second, network dependency may impede access to cloud services that may be outside of organizational control. A senior executive expressed concerns over lack of adequate network bandwidth and server storage: In our industry, speed of execution of processes is paramount. Depending on a cloud provider creates huge risks related to our dependence on the network capacity and reliability (14, CTO). Another organization noted the need to establish a common set of controls across all partners in a cloud network. What are those basic controls that need to be built into one’s

network (7, CTO). When the access to the network is not reliable or available, cloud services and applications would be interrupted, which may lead to a serious negative economic impact on critical organizational processes. As a response to this challenge, many organizations, especially in the public sector, use only private clouds as a mechanism to maximize their decision rights and control over the IT infrastructure and applications deployed on the cloud: in our business, response time is critical and any degradation will have huge impact on our bottom line. We decided to use a private cloud for these types of processes (14, COO). In addition, organizations develop redundant cloud services to reduce their network dependency. We also put in place multiple pipes so that if there is a surge in transaction volume, we can handle this in this cloud, explains the CTO (14, CTO). Third, misaligned IT skills can be a challenge to organizations that switch to cloud computing. A senior executive highlighted the mismatch between existing and required IT skills: The challenges with standing up and managing the elements associated with solution roll out. Because those things can now be started up much more readily, there is less of a need – a reduced need for those folks; however, there is a greater need for architecture expertise (5, Chief Scientist). IT departments may resist the adoption of cloud computing and prefer to play the role of a service broker rather than that of a service provider if they do not possess the appropriate skills. In such cases, even business units may be unwilling to migrate to the cloud because they may not be adequately prepared to manage the signiﬁcant changes in the way in which they obtain IT services. The CMO of a retailer explained this dilemma. We could probably get better services outside and our IT folks are resisting this move to the cloud because they will get marginalized. Strangely, our own business users also prefer to deal with internal IT rather than a cloud provider because they don’t feel conﬁdent about relying on someone outside the organization (13, CMO) To address this issue, many focal organizations recruited and/or trained IT personnel so that they can create and manage SLA contracts with cloud computing providers: I think at least in the short and mid-term, it has actually increased staff particularly from us consultants because the employees in some cases didn’t have the skills or expertise to handle the issues they were getting (5, VP); we get those individuals repurposed within the organization, what skills we now need to start getting our folks accustomed to because this is probably one of many new directions and I think our operational model now becomes a little bit different (1, Manager). Fourth, organizations may need signiﬁcant resources for the integration and coordination of cloud computing services with existing IT infrastructure. A retailer noted that the service components made available by a cloud provider were not the best match for the speciﬁc needs of the organization: We learnt quickly that many of the cloud providers were providing services that were too generic for us to conﬁgure or tailor easily to our speciﬁc needs (13, CMO). A signiﬁcant switching cost involved in integrating and

coordinating cloud computing services may prevent organizations from adopting cloud computing. Some organizations had to invest considerable effort in discovering and examining the services before selecting the ones that best meet their requirements: We had to evaluate several offerings to settle on one that matched our needs the most. I didn’t say exactly, but it was a sufﬁcient match. Here is a tradeoff we were willing to live with (13, CMO). They also recognized that they might not ﬁnd a perfect match in all situations. Incremental adoption of cloud computing and developing technical and managerial competencies over time may help organizations develop their capability for integrating and coordinating cloud computing services with their internal IT infrastructure. Lastly, expected cost savings may not be realized even though it is one of the primary reasons for the adoption of cloud computing. A large public organization incurred signiﬁcant hidden costs associated with the adoption of cloud computing, There is a hidden cost that you don’t know about or you don’t think about right off the bat. Now we have gone to cloud, we have to not only search our own systems but we have to pay another organization to search the ones in the cloud. There is – well they talk about well you can salvage the cloud but the problem is last time we did those actions it might have cost us a million dollars (1, Associate CIO). Another organization had to invest heavily to ensure application security. We turned to a cloud service that allowed us to do that but there is a fee associated with the use of that service for strong authentication users, which provides an attack vector that we hadn’t anticipated. And that was just use of the system – authentication system costs a lot of money (5, Chief Scientist). A manager of a focal organization suggested that cost savings should be made over time through mature practices. It may not necessarily be an initial cost savings but when it comes to hardware replacement cycle part when it comes to licensing and monitoring and all that, stafﬁng, making sure you have the resources that are trained on the next version or whatever is out there. I can see possibly over long term as the solution gets more reﬁned, more mature, that you will see cost savings over time (1, Manager).

are provided with IT infrastructure services. From the customer perspective is the speed, right, that they get delivered at I think from the infrastructure as a service perspective is the ability to reduce the time to acquire the server. From six months, we can cut it down to one week. That makes the customer very happy (9, CTO). A VP of a private sector infrastructure provider cites signiﬁcant savings realized by public organizations. The CIO of the Federal government testiﬁed that there had been approximately $100 million of savings as a result of Cloud, and I think that is just an example of the overall trend that is clearly driving efﬁciencies across the industry (3, VP). He further elaborates that an automation capability and selfservice enabled by cloud computing signiﬁcantly improve performance at both the technology utilization level and the project execution level. In addition to affecting the bottom line in the near term, these beneﬁts help position the organization for sustained competitive advantage, explains a director in this organization. The particular product [the cloud provider] has given us a dashboard – a mirror into our pipeline and how many opportunities we have – forecasting a way to converse with the sales people. I think deﬁnitely on our sales side it has enabled us to turnaround proposals and budget quotes a lot faster (6, Director of Sales). Further, these capabilities can be leveraged to achieve signiﬁcant savings in infrastructure costs resulting from the use of cloud storage. We have seen our storage [costs] previously growing at a rate of about 30% a year and this year is the ﬁrst year we haven’t had to add any new storage. What previously was costing us millions of dollars a year to grow our storage to meet demand, this year for the ﬁrst year has leveled off. So, that’s, I think, a great story (2, CIO). In summary, the use of cloud computing to transform business processes at the focal organizations of our investigation has resulted in not only increased efﬁciencies in terms of cost and time to serve customers but also increased effectiveness in terms of the ability to offer innovative products and services, as well as quality and customer satisfaction.

Discussion
Our research seeks to contribute to the literature on dynamic capabilities by identifying speciﬁc business process transformations, agility, and entrepreneurial alertness enabled by cloud computing. We develop a richer understanding of sense-and-respond strategies such as dynamic commitments and modular design that enable business process transformations, agility, and entrepreneurial alertness. This research also contributes to the literature on IS architecture competency in the context of cloud computing, an emerging paradigm of organizational computing.

Performance We now examine how organizations improved efﬁciencies and effectiveness in the development and delivery of products and services as a result of the transformations discussed above. The CIO of a public sector organization states, Agile capabilities of the Cloud have allowed us to tackle application development in a different and more rapid manner (2, CIO). A director in a ﬁeld service organization comments, We have gotten much closer to understanding our customers and the closure of sales we have in the system. [Also] the service is much more highly available than the previous system we were running. We haven’t had any downtime, we don’t have any outages (6, Director of Sales). The CTO of a public sector organization provides an example of signiﬁcant improvements in the speed with which his customers

Dynamic capabilities Extant research suggests that the type of capabilities developed by organizations is dependent on the level of market dynamism within the external environment (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). For example, capabilities developed in high velocity markets are based on simple

processes that have been developed through rapid, iterative, and experience-based learning. Our ﬁndings are consistent with this observation in that organizations achieved dynamic capabilities through repeated experimentation with simple and modular processes that were tailored to suit the new architecture enabled by cloud computing. While the basic capabilities provided by cloud computing may not differ much from those provided by traditional models of computing, the ability to rapidly develop, deploy, and scale IT resources facilitates the redesign of digital options in business process, as well as achieving agility and entrepreneurial alertness within the organizational boundaries. It further helps the redesign of business networks and even the redeﬁnition of the scope of the business. This demonstrates the reach and richness of digitized process capital that are enabled by cloud computing to innovate inter- and intra-organizational work processes. While the building blocks of these capabilities are indeed quite simple, their modularity enables organizations to create capabilities that are complex, difﬁcult to imitate, and responsive to change (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). The ﬁndings from our study correspond closely to the role of dynamic capabilities that have been observed in NPD (El Sawy & Pavlou, 2008; Pavlou & El Sawy, 2011). Speciﬁcally, the ability to create processes that help learn about customer needs (using, e.g., cloud-based analytics that were observed in our study) corresponds to the ability to sense and learn. Similarly, dynamic commitments and context-speciﬁc governance mechanisms observed in our study correspond to the coordinating activities involving orchestrating and reconﬁguring of tasks that are necessary to achieve new operational capabilities (El Sawy & Pavlou, 2008; Pavlou & El Sawy, 2011). Finally, the ability to create modular designs corresponds to the ability to integrate knowledge in collective sense-making. Our ﬁndings differ from those of Pavlou and El Sawy in that our research identiﬁes the speciﬁc transformations of organizational business processes and inter-organizational networks that are facilitated by cloud computing. While Pavlou and El Sawy proposed and empirically tested the link between dynamic capabilities and performance, our study extends the link by integrating it with transformations (e.g., business process redesign, business network redesign, and business scope redeﬁnition) enabled by IT capabilities such as cloud computing. We also note that cloud computing enables organizations to be alert to changes in the business environment and agile in responding to them. While the capabilities such as modular processes and dynamic commitment observed in our study are better aligned with ‘disciplined ﬂexibility’ (El Sawy & Pavlou, 2008) that provide dynamic capabilities, cloud computing also provides opportunities for ‘enterprises to learn how to be prepared to respond to any novel situation’ (El Sawy & Pavlou, 2008). The development of such ‘improvisational capabilities’ may be facilitated by the ability to reach beyond the boundaries of the organization and exploit the capabilities provided by a cloud

vendor or a partner organization to learn about the environment, customers, and operations. Similarly, drawing from prior work (Smith et al, 1992; D’Aveni, 1994), Sambamurthy et al (2003) suggest that the ‘logic of leverage’ obtained with technology may be helpful in moderately dynamic markets, but it may not help achieve longterm competitive advantage in fast-paced business environments. While our study identiﬁes several mechanisms for achieving dynamic capabilities in moderately dynamic markets, it also provides some interesting insights into how cloud computing may be used by organizations to achieve a series of short-term advantages in high velocity markets. Speciﬁcally, cloud computing enables rapid and continuous innovations by making it possible to sense market opportunities and seize them through dynamic commitment of resources that have been identiﬁed as crucial in such environments (Eisenhardt, 1989; Brown & Eisenhardt, 1997). Thus, our study contributes to our understanding of how the same technology platform can enable competitive advantage in both types of contexts and thus extends the prior literature that has so far examined the role of technology separately in the two types of environments. In fact, our results suggest the need to reconceptualize the role of disruptive technologies such as cloud computing in novel ways because of their ability to support multiple organizational capabilities like never before.

Achieving dynamic capabilities Our study may also be viewed as a response to the call by Sambamurthy et al (2003) to empirically investigate how IT can provide three types of dynamic capabilities – agility, digital options, and entrepreneurial alertness – to an organization. Our study examines how organizations have been able to achieve these capabilities through four senseand-respond strategies. For example, the leverage obtained through building capabilities (Grant, 1996; Teece et al, 1997) for a ﬁrm to ‘integrate, build, and reconﬁgure internal and external resources in creating the higherorder capabilities’ (Sambamurthy et al, 2003) is illustrated in the three types of transformations presented in our results. These capabilities, in fact, match well with the dynamic capabilities in that they helped organizations create and evolve processes or routines to achieve dynamic reconﬁgurations of resources (both internal and external) as the environmental conditions changed (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). The ability to exploit the ‘logic of opportunity’ (Sambamurthy et al, 2003) is also examined in our study. As organizations lost their leverage, they were able to generate new knowledge about their customers and the environment and create new resource conﬁgurations (through the three types of transformation). Furthermore, the ability to exploit new technological shifts (say, mobile computing and software as a service) also enabled organizations to continuously innovate by creating new markets

for existing products and services as well as by creating new products and services. As theorized by Eisenhardt and colleagues (Eisenhardt & Brown, 1999; Eisenhardt & Galunic, 2000; Eisenhardt & Sull, 2001), the co-evolution of strategic processes was also facilitated by cloud computing through the transformation of business networks. Our study offers evidence that cloud computing extends the concept of ‘shared assets’ (Eisenhardt & Galunic, 2000, pp. 91–92) in radical ways compared to almost any other IT advances that has been examined until now. Speciﬁcally, our study suggests that cloud computing provides unprecedented ﬂexibility in the way organizations can use IT and non-IT assets, capabilities, and knowledge that they can bring together to respond to the environment. In fact, the dynamism with which this can be accomplished is also illustrated in our study, especially with the ability to learn about emerging market opportunities and threats. Thus, our study represents one of the ﬁrst attempts at explaining how IT can help organizations develop and continually pursue the logic of opportunity. One of the critical challenges to achieving dynamic capabilities is the limitation created by path dependencies. Speciﬁcally, path dependencies limit the pursuit of strategies that follow the logic of opportunity (Teece et al, 1997). Interestingly, our study illustrates the ability of cloud computing to free organizations from path dependencies created by embedded relationships within and outside the organizations. For example, modular design supported by cloud computing is an enabler of business network transformation. Instead of engaging in tightly woven networks, organizations are able to plug-and-play in a loosely coupled network of relationships that can be reshaped in response to emerging needs. However, although such ‘weak ties’ provide strategic ﬂexibility, their implications for creating and maintaining inimitable capabilities merit further examination. In summary, our study suggests that cloud computing may accelerate the ability of an organization to use IT as a platform for achieving dynamic capabilities. Our study illustrates the ability of cloud computing to help rapidly integrate and reconﬁgure key organizational processes, relationships, and business networks in ways that were previously infeasible. Thus, cloud computing serves as an excellent exemplar of a ‘digitized platform for processes and knowledge’ that enables organizations to ‘respond to changing information-based value propositions, forge value-chain collaborations with partners that competitors cannot easily duplicate, and rapidly exploit emerging and untapped market niches’ (Sambamurthy et al, 2003). Recent research observes that organizations that have developed process-oriented dynamic capabilities are able to improve ineffective operational processes so that they are better, faster, and cheaper than their competitors, which in turn will help them respond to changing business environments (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Butler & Murphy, 2008). Further, it is argued that ﬁrms can outperform competitors by responding more effectively to changing environments with the help of enhanced communication, coordination,

and information sharing (Tippins & Sohi, 2003). Our research reinforces these ﬁndings by analyzing organizations that may develop dynamic capabilities enabled by cloud computing that enhance communication, coordination, and information sharing. The use of cloud-enabled social media platforms and cloud-based analytics by organizations are excellent examples. In addition, we identify how organizations can extend their capabilities by enhancing their relationships with partners in the value chain (such as customers) and thus respond to dynamic market situations. For organizations to survive in challenging environment, they may exploit appropriate external technology capabilities offered by cloud computing instead of relying solely upon internal technical capabilities (Arora & Nandkumar, 2012). The ability to sustain competitive advantage with cloud computing may be limited when the same technology is widely available and adopted by competitors. Therefore, organizations need to raise barriers to imitation by developing tacitness, complexity, and speciﬁcity in using cloud computing (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990). In summary, while there has been signiﬁcant interest in understanding the role of dynamic capabilities provided by IT (Wheeler, 2002; Tan et al, 2004), the elucidation of how organizations deploy IT resources and how these help ﬁrms create capabilities that enable them to thrive in dynamic markets remains underexplored in the current IS literature (Montealegre, 2002; Wade & Hulland, 2004). In fact, because the business value of IT has been difﬁcult to quantify, many suggest that IT should be viewed as a strategic necessity, that is, it is necessary but not sufﬁcient for achieving competitive advantage (Clemons & Row, 1991). Our research challenges this conclusion by describing how cloud computing, indeed, provides organizations with competitive advantage. In this sense, our results are consistent with similar observations from recent research (Bharadwaj, 2000; Sambamurthy et al, 2003; El Sawy & Pavlou, 2008).

Disruptive role of technology The business process transformations observed in our study enable organizations to create innovative products and services. Innovation, deﬁned as the ‘creation of any product, service, or process which is new to a business unit’ (Tushman & Nadler, 1986), has been considered to range from the reﬁnement of existing designs to the introduction of new concepts that are signiﬁcantly different from past practices (Henderson & Clark, 1990). While incremental innovation focuses on leveraging existing design through minor changes, radical innovation is based on a new set of principles that might result in the redeﬁnition of an industry. Henderson & Clark (1990) argue that the dichotomy is insufﬁcient to explain certain types of innovation; they introduce the notion of architectural innovation wherein core design concepts are unchanged but the linkages between components are drastically changed. The nature of innovations observed in our study corresponds well to this concept of architectural

innovation. Cloud computing as an innovative technology accompanies architectural changes (Walsh et al, 2002; Bernstein et al, 2009; Dillon et al, 2010) in IS. Changes in the hardware and software components and their interconnections make cloud architecture distinctly different from other computing models. For example, cloud computing often uses industry standard interfaces (e.g., web services, service-oriented architecture, representational state transfer, or any proprietary services) (Sultan & van de Bunt-Kokhuis, 2012) to achieve interoperability and integration unlike never before. Lyytinen & Rose (2003) observe that such innovative changes in the hardware and software architectures are necessary to have a transformative effect on system development and service provision. Our study provides empirical evidence for this observation by identifying several ways in which both provider and client organizations are able to exploit architectural innovation enabled by cloud computing to deeply modify and shape IT organizations as well as core organizational processes enabled by IT. Our ﬁndings are also different from those of prior research that examines the disruptive role of technology in organizational processes. Edmondson et al (2001) observe that existing routines and status relationships presented barriers to the adoption of technology. While inertia was indeed observed in our study, there were episodes of improvised learning (Boudreau & Robey, 2005) wherein individuals adapted technology solutions without having to follow established structures, along with the outcomes of such adaptations resulting in wider adoptions of such variations. Plausible reasons for such adaptations may be the dynamic market that drives initiatives that improve efﬁciency and effectiveness. Rapid developments in technology capabilities such as mobile computing that are facilitated by cloud computing may also explain such adaptations. Besson & Rowe (2012) found ﬁve dimensions of organizational inertia that entrench organizations and cause existing management patterns to become rigid: negative psychology inertia, socio-cognitive inertia, socio-technical inertia, economic inertia, and political inertia. We note that most of the challenges to achieving dynamic capabilities by using cloud computing result from economic inertia. A negative psychology inertia is signiﬁcant at the individual or group level, while the other inertias are signiﬁcant at the business and sector level. According to Besson & Rowe (2012), among all these inertias that impede transformation, economic inertia deserves special attention in IS research. In economic inertia, agents of change are embedded in existing business models that have their own resource allocation dynamics. For example, some organizations cannot commit to IS transformation that is necessitated by cloud adoption owing to high sunk costs associated with their existing IT infrastructure. Because cloud computing is a technology that can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence existing resource allocation in organizations, the economic inertia perspective provides an interesting lens for examining the challenges faced by

organizations adopting it. Kumar & van Hillegersberg (2000) identify similar challenges in matching generic processes embedded in ERP systems with situation-speciﬁc requirements in an organization. Indeed, such a challenge has been observed with the introduction of what Wang (2010) call IT fashion. In their study on the effects of IT fashion on the performance of organizations, they ﬁnd that when organizations chase the fashions, their investments lead to lower levels of performance in the short term and then higher levels of performance in the long term. Because cloud computing may be classiﬁed as an IT fashion at this time, similar effects may be observed in investments in this technology as well.

Contributions
Contributions to research Our study offers contextually sensitive contributions (Chiasson & Davidson, 2004) to IS, with its examination of IT-enabled transformation using cloud computing. First, we demonstrate how organizations responded to market dynamism by investing and using cloud computing. It highlights how cloud computing can help organizations overcome the limitations of traditional IS and transform their business. Second, following Teece’s (2007) call for studies to develop microfoundations of dynamic capabilities, we examine how cloud computing helps organizations sense, seize, and reconﬁgure their resources to improve their business. Speciﬁcally, we introduce senseand-respond strategies and cloud-computing-enabled transformations to explain how organizations may achieve dynamic capabilities and improve performance. Speciﬁcally, our study addresses the research question (How do organizations achieve dynamic capabilities by using cloud computing?) by developing a framework (presented in Figure 1) that represents our research contribution by linking sense-and-respond strategies and cloud-computing-enabled transformations. Through the framework, we explain how organizations using cloud computing are able to sense and respond to a dynamic market environment through the lens of four sense-and-respond strategies (Gavetti & Levinthal, 2000; Teece, 2007). Our study explains how organizations can search, sense, seize, and reconﬁgure cloud computing resources for achieving dynamic capabilities. Our framework also shows that these strategies enable organizations to shape three transformations driven by cloud computing. We present interesting and applicable ﬁndings related to the use of cloud computing for achieving dynamic capabilities. Our ﬁndings shed light on how organizations with dynamic capabilities enabled by the use of cloud computing improve performance in terms of effectiveness and efﬁciency. Our framework also provides a comprehensive view of the factors that both support and hinder the development of dynamic capabilities using cloud computing. We contribute to literature on dynamic capabilities by identifying transformational changes of business processes and inter-organizational networks that are enabled by

cloud computing. These transformations include business process redesign, business network redesign, and business scope redeﬁnition. While El Sawy and Pavlou’s (El Sawy & Pavlou, 2008; Pavlou & El Sawy, 2011) work focuses on the role of dynamic capabilities to improve operational performance, our study enhances the perspective of performance improvement by including not only business process redesign but also business network redesign and business scope redeﬁnition. We identify how the essential characteristics of cloud computing support sense and respond strategies. Cloud computing’s resource pooling and rapid elasticity support the ﬁrst strategy: dynamic commitment of resources. Organizations can pool cloud computing providers’ resources and dynamically assign them according to market demand. Cloud computing’s on-demand self-service and broad network access support the second strategy: designing modular processes. Organizations can automatically provision IT capabilities when needed without requiring human interaction with the service provider. In addition these computing capabilities are accessible through standard mechanisms thereby supporting the development of modular processes. Finally cloud computing’s measured service supports the third strategy: designing context-speciﬁc governance mechanisms. A pay-as-you-go model leveraged by a metering capability of cloud computing enables organizations to develop value-based governance and accountability thereby supporting the third strategy.

cloud based solution provided by external vendors, and create and manage service level agreements with cloud computing providers.

Conclusions, limitations and future research
Our study offers novel insights into how cloud computing may enable organizations to develop dynamic capabilities by achieving transformations of business processes, business networks, and business scope. These may be achieved with the use of four sense-and-respond strategies. In addition, our study highlights the unique and unprecedented ability of this technology to facilitate the development of a wide variety of capabilities that were difﬁcult to achieve economically with investments in traditional IT/IS infrastructure. Generalization of our ﬁndings in other contexts that involve the adoption of other ITs should be carried out with caution because the ﬁndings may be particularistic to the speciﬁc characteristics of cloud computing, and to the sites we studied. For example, we acknowledge that the use of the similar cloud computing services by the organizations studied as well as their high levels of maturity in adopting cloud computing may limit the generalizability of our ﬁndings. Our ﬁndings may not apply well to organizations that use different cloud computing services and are at different level of maturity in their adoption of cloud computing. As noted by Eriksson (2014), the outcomes of dynamic capabilities enabled by cloud computing may not necessarily be positive, and therefore, our ﬁndings should be interpreted with caution. Future research is needed to examine the need for organizations to adapt their processes to take advantage of the capabilities offered on the cloud computing platform. For example, a cloud supported only an earlier version of a software development environment than that was being used in the client organization. After the application was developed on the external cloud, the client organization had to port it to its internal cloud environment to take advantage of the new features that were supported in this environment. However, because our study was not focused on such adaptations that may be essential for successful adoption of cloud computing, we suggest the need for more detailed studies. Our study provides a fertile foundation for large-scale quantitative studies that can examine speciﬁc factors that help organizations in balancing the need for operational and dynamic capabilities with cloud computing. The link between the ability to balance such priorities and organizational performance is a subject of ongoing research. Future research is also needed to identify key differences between cloud computing and other IS fashions to gain insights into how cloud computing may offer distinct capabilities. Because cloud computing represents a paradigm shift in computing, more detailed studies are needed to examine its potential as well as the challenges it poses to organizations, both small and large.

Contributions to IS practice Our contributions to IS practice are aimed at three groups of stakeholders. First, our implications for senior management include the nuanced view of the role of cloud computing. Rather than pursuing cloud computing only as a way to increase operational efﬁciencies, senior management needs to recognize the more transformative role of cloud computing in the redesign of both internally and externally focused business processes. Explicit consideration of the range of transformations that are enabled by cloud computing will help senior management appropriately evaluate technology investments in this area. Second, vendors who develop cloud computing solutions should recognize the potentially far-reaching transformative role that their solutions may provide to organizations. Creating modular, reconﬁgurable solutions will help their clients create innovative conﬁgurations of capabilities that best meet the dynamic needs of their customers. The farreaching potential of the transformations provided by cloud computing, however, will also likely increase the demand for higher levels of quality (such as security, availability, and performance). Therefore, solutions providers need to carefully consider these requirements when developing their solutions. Third, managers in IT organizations need to recruit and/ or train IT personnel with knowledge and skills needed to develop private cloud solutions, acquire and integrate
