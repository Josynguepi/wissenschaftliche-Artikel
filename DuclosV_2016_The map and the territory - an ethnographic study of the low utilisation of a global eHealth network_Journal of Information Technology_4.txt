Abstract Recent years were marked by the implementation of many eHealth projects using information and communication technologies to provide health services in developing countries. While generating great expectations, these projects remain poorly documented and available data suggest high failure rates. This raises a practical question: How are such eHealth networks to be effectively designed and implemented? This paper addresses this question. Speciﬁcally, it presents an ethnographic study of the Pan-African e-Network, a project which connects many hospitals all across India and Africa, providing medical teleconsultations and distance learning services. The study investigates the low utilisation of the network, an issue undermining its potential and efﬁciency. Factors contributing to this situation include communication barriers, the presumed ego of doctors, poor awareness of the project, and a lack of ﬂexibility to work with the speciﬁcities of the connected sites. Above all, these factors point towards a dichotomous approach across the project’s design and implementation, and taking two distinct yet related forms: (a) an ontological divide between technical and ‘non-technical’ domains; (b) a political sorting out of what is and what is not the project, aimed at neutralising and accounting for heterogeneous processes and practices. In both cases, low utilisation reveals tensions between processes of closure and control, and the openness of a life that will not be contained. Ultimately, this paper intends to destabilise binary modes of thinking as they crystallise oppositions between design and implementation, project and context, technical and social worlds, efﬁcacy and improvisation, mastery and unruliness, map and territory.

Introduction n 16 September 2004, during the inaugural session of the Pan-African Parliament in Johannesburg, the former Indian President Dr. Abdul Kalam proposed to connect every country of the African Union with India through a digital network that would provide connectivity for eHealth and tele-education activities. Five years later, the Pan-African e-Network was launched. The Pan-African e-Network is a colossal and multifaceted project, connecting hospitals across India and the African continent. Funded by the Indian state and implemented in cooperation with the African Union, the network is heralded

as the largest information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure project in Africa (Broadman, 2007: 282). It connects 12 tertiary care hospitals in India with over 30 hospitals located in as many African countries to deliver two forms of medical services: teleconsultations and continuing medical education. Covering a wide range of medical specialties, both are aimed at empowering clinical decision making and ultimately, at caring for patients at a distance. While the scale of its digital infrastructure and the magnitude of its technical, political, and ﬁnancial resources endow the Pan-African e-Network with a unique character, the

implementation of a global network dedicated to eHealth services is not exceptional. Driven by the leadership of the World Health Organization (WHO), local governments, NGOs, and private sector players, the last few years have seen the emergence of an array of similar initiatives (WHO, 2005; WHO, 2010). Networks have been implemented in various contexts such as natural disaster and war zones (Merrell et al., 2008), humanitarian settings (Wootton et al., 2012), or as part of broader development schemes (Miscione, 2007; Duclos, 2012). Global eHealth raises expectations in terms of future outcomes. It has been referred to as the ‘next breakthrough in health systems improvement in developing nations’ (Gerber et al., 2010), as ‘a great equalizer between rich and poor, healthy and ill’ (Rockefeller Foundation, 2010: 51), or as a ‘lifesaving tool’ (Vital Wave Consulting, 2012). It is expected to render distance meaningless and to contribute to breaking down barriers in the provision of healthcare (Bashshur and Shannon, 2009). At the heart of such expectations lies the conviction that adopting ICT-based solutions should lead to enhanced efﬁciency in healthcare delivery (WHO Regional Ofﬁce for Africa, 2008; Pan American Health Organization, 2011; European Commission, 2012). In contrast with such expectations, there is so far very little evidence of the actual impact, or efﬁciency, of global eHealth projects thus far implemented. Furthermore, some studies suggest that a signiﬁcant proportion of initiatives have failed to live up to expectations. This is, to a large extent, the case of the Pan-African e-Network. The main reason for this is that the network is experiencing low utilisation issues. The aim of this paper is thus to examine the factors involved in the low utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network, with special emphasis on the design and implementation of the project. Speciﬁcally, it examines the relation between the design of the network – how it was projected – and how the network is experienced and enacted in practice. To do so, the paper draws upon an ethnographic study of the Pan-African e-Network. As this paper will show, many factors contribute to the poor utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network. These include technical issues, language barriers, the recalcitrance of some African doctors in using the network, a lack of awareness of the existence of the network and of its potential beneﬁts, poor institutional integration, and a lack of ﬂexibility to work with the speciﬁcities of the connected sites. However, identifying these individual factors is not sufﬁcient to understand the issue at stake. Above all, this paper argues that all of these factors are contingent on a dichotomous approach across project’s design and implementation. This approach takes two primary forms: (a) an ontological divide between technical and ‘non-technical’ domains; (b) a political sorting out what is and what is not the project, aimed at neutralising and accounting for heterogeneous processes and practices. In both cases, low utilisation reveals a whole series of tensions between processes of closure and control, and the openness of a life that will not be contained (Ingold, 2011: 83). To the widespread conception of a seamless circulation of expertise and knowledge, this examination of the Pan-African e-Network opposes the embeddedness and plasticity of concrete practices. In contrast with modes of perceiving and making the world – incorporated within the project itself – as if it were a connected, ordered and predictable whole, I suggest that connecting the world entails engaging and transforming it in creative and often unpredictable ways. In other words,

ethnographic enquiry exposes a series of entanglements, and captures asymmetries between the network as anticipation and the network as it is lived and experienced. Ultimately, this paper intends to destabilise binary modes of thinking as they crystallise oppositions between design and implementation, technology and context, projects and processes, efﬁcacy and instability, mastery and unruliness, map and territory. The paper starts by presenting epistemological and ontological tensions between different approaches to the frequent failures of eHealth and ICT4D initiatives. It ﬁrst introduces dominant universalistic approaches and then contrasts them with studies emphasising the organisational, social, and political embeddedness of eHealth practices. The paper then turns to the issue of the low utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network. It scrutinises the main factors contributing to this situation, drawing from ﬁeld observations and interviews conducted with actors of the project. This leads to a conceptual discussion of the above-mentioned dichotomous approach and of its principal manifestations. eHealth: failure and its responses As mentioned earlier, global eHealth raises great expectations. However, a review of literature indicates an exceptionally poor track record in systematically documenting the actual input of eHealth interventions (Roine et al., 2001, Whitten et al., 2002; Reardon, 2005). Speciﬁcally, there is little evidence of the impact or efﬁciency of eHealth in ‘non-Western’, or developing contexts (Rigby, 2002; Blaya et al., 2010; Wootton and Bonnardot, 2010). Furthermore, the few studies carried out so far suggest that a large proportion of global eHealth initiatives have failed to live up to expectations (WHO, 2010; Wootton and Bonnardot, 2010; Isabalija et al., 2011). Obstacles to a successful implementation of eHealth initiatives include technical limitations, ethical and legal issues, exhaustion of funding, lack of political support, computer illiteracy, as well as cultural and linguistic differences (Bagayoko et al., 2006; Bukachi and PakenhamWalsh, 2007; Mars and Scott, 2010). At the heart of concerns about the efﬁciency of eHealth initiatives in the developing world, lies a critical issue: the poor utilisation of the initiatives implemented (Wootton, 2008; Khoja and Naseem, 2009). Responses to project failure, including issues of low utilisation, are broad and diversiﬁed. The next section surveys these responses, grouping them in two distinct categories: approaches that insist on the need for evidence-based, best practice standards and interventions; approaches that focus on the singularity, embeddedness, and relationality inherent to eHealth projects. Understanding failure Evidence-based approaches: setting universal standards Many actors from the eHealth sector have signalled the urgency to develop evaluation methods, critical success factors, and best practice standards (Dentzer, 2010, Kahn et al., 2010, Piette et al., 2012). Calls for evidence-based research abound and reports from international agencies and funding institutions are insistent: policymakers have to incentivise impact assessment, if global eHealth is to become mainstreamed ‘as a cost-cutting and life-saving tool’ (Vital Wave Consulting, 2012: 3). The WHO has warned that, in order to become essential, eHealth interventions have to meet

well-deﬁned speciﬁcations and to be validated through controlled clinical studies (WHO, 2004: 6). For evidence-based advocates, eHealth belongs to a whole family of global health interventions that have to be rationalised. In keeping with this, authors have tried to investigate factors contributing to eHealth adoption using theoretical models of technology acceptance (Ami-Narh and Williams, 2012). Some have examined the applicability of well-known models – such as the Technology Acceptance Model – in explaining decisions to accept to use ICTs in various health contexts (Hu et al., 1999). Others have developed ‘eHealth readiness’ assessment tools to measure the preparedness of healthcare institutions or communities for the anticipated change brought by eHealth (Khoja et al., 2007). All in all, guidelines and frameworks aimed at promoting best-practice implementation approaches are multiplying (Van Dyk, 2014). They have become the basis on which ICT investments are deployed in health institutions, on both local or global scales (Coleman and Coleman, 2013). Such attempts at bridging the ‘evidence divide’ are nothing new in the broader ICT4D sector. The lack of evaluation of ICT4D initiatives is remarkable, and well-documented applications of successful ICT4D interventions in developing countries are difﬁcult to ﬁnd (Krishna and Madon, 2003; Walsham et al., 2007; Unwin, 2009). Over a decade ago, Heeks noted that while the evidence base is not strong, it all points ‘toward high rates of IS failure in developing countries’ (Heeks, 2002a: 103). Since then, debates about what should count as legitimate knowledge, or what producing evidence is all about have increased. The need for stakeholders to develop impact assessment techniques has been strongly afﬁrmed. Some have defended the import of epistemic tools such as randomized control trials to further the marshalling of evidence in development activities (Banerjee and Duﬂo, 2011). Such tools have been presented as evidence of ICT4D’s maturation and welcomed as efforts to clarify and compare different techniques (Hayes and Westrup, 2012b). As Hayes and Westrup (2012b) suggest, impact assessment has become a normalising force actively involved in shaping the domain of ICT4D. It generates truth claims about what is and is not legitimate in project implementation, and thus inﬂuences the way we understand and undertake development. In sum, responses in this ﬁrst category share a commitment that the widespread adoption of eHealth depends on the establishment of an evidence-based (Al-Shorbaji and Geissbuhler, 2012). They are premised on the conviction that only such an evidence shall, in turn, help inform decisions on e-health and its application in ways that will make it successful and sustainable. Embeddedness, ﬂuidity, and relationality of networks Evidence-based approaches often acknowledge the importance of contexts in which ICT4D projects and systems are implemented (Prakash and De, 2007). Authors have for instance argued that project implementation and assessment should take into account factors such as the use of ‘appropriate’ technology (Reijswoud, 2009), the importance of community ownership (Gumucio-Dagron, 2003), of cultural speciﬁcities (Straub et al., 2001), and local pluralism (Ramirez, 2003). However, the notion of ‘context’ cannot be taken for granted within this discussion. As Avgerou (2010: 4)

has rightfully noted, even when taking context into consideration, universalistic approaches still assume an overriding rationality that determines universal goals of ICT innovation. They also assume a single logic of action towards the satisfaction of these goals – a logic in which evidence-based impact assessment is playing a central role, as discussed earlier. In contrast, studies adopting what Avgerou (2008) coined as a ‘social embeddedness’ perspective contend that ICT innovation is enacted by social actors and as such, they tend to place emphasis on meaning making and practice within the immediate setting of the site where a given project is implemented (Avgerou, 2010: 4). Studies have for instance underscored the embeddedness of information systems in various techno-organisational arrangements and settings, particularly in developing countries (Sahay and Walsham, 2006). They have insisted that the trajectory of ICT4D initiatives cannot be understood by looking at the technological features only, and that one has to observe the interplay between the actors involved, placing them into broader frameworks (economic, geopolitical, etc.) to offer a new interpretation of their concrete actions (Ciborra, 2005). Heeks (2002b) has for instance suggested that a major reason for the failure of information systems projects in developing countries is the mismatch or gap between system design and the actuality of organisational practice. In this regard, ICT4D scholarship would also beneﬁt by paying closer attention to a large body of multi-disciplinary work that has, over the last two decades or so, examined the complex intertwinements of technical and social worlds. Although distinct in many ways, these studies contest the dualism of technical/social (or non-technical) worlds, and the apparent ‘solidity’ of the technical form it is premised upon (Bloomﬁeld and Vurdubakis, 1994). In contrast, they tend to insist on the ﬂuidity and relationality inherent to sociotechnical entities in practice (de Laet and Mol, 2000; Law, 2002). Drawing from these approaches, qualitative studies of eHealth networks in Western settings have analysed the various processes at play in project design and implementation (Moser and Law, 2006; Jensen, 2010). In doing so, they have built on recent critical examinations, across the social sciences and humanities – especially in the STS ﬁeld – of prevalent conceptions of networking (Latour, 1999; Mackenzie, 2010; Munster, 2013). These tend to contest representations of the network as a neutral, predictable device. Studies have thus analysed the role played by such conceptions in framing eHealth in terms of seamless transmission and mobility (Mort et al., 2009). They have also problematised widespread conceptions of information as stable and unchanging, and the associated expectation of linear organisational change through its transmission (Miscione, 2007). Studies have suggested that such conceptions are located at the core of the possibility to portray local contexts as blank slates upon which eHealth services may be introduced without any great difﬁculty (Oudshoorn, 2012). They have insisted on the ‘artful integrations’ (Suchman, 1993) of human – machine relations in a constantly moving medical practice, suggesting that knowledge coproduced by patients, clinicians, and machines could shape the design, practice, and evaluation of eHealth networks (Mort and Smith, 2009). In order to comprehend such integrations, some have called for a deepening awareness of the work required to achieve technology stabilisation (Suchman, 2002). Others have engaged in ontological exploration of how science

and technology enact their objects in practice (Mol, 2002; Barad, 2007; Gad et al., 2015). These studies have emphasised the need to consider information projects and infrastructure as ‘performative forces’ (Cordella, 2002), and to examine how certain practices are actively shaping them. In doing so, they draw attention to the labour, corporeality, and power relations inherent in eHealth projects and networks. By insisting on relationality inherent to eHealth – and indeed ICT4D – projects, these approaches challenge a basic epistemological premise underlying impact assessment methodologies: the separation between universally valid knowledge and speciﬁc, local contexts. In fact, what is being challenged altogether is the assumption of a layered (part/ whole) context, conceived as a discrete, self-evident entity to be represented or embedded in (Hayes and Westrup, 2012a). By destabilising the dichotomy between project and context, the attention is drawn to how contextualising moves occur as part of processes of ICT4D – that is, to context as a relational, enacted formulation (ibid.). All in all, in contrast with narratives of uniformity and predictability, such approaches reframe the issue of project success or failure in terms of relations to speciﬁc sites and practices. That is to say, this speciﬁcity can’t be subsumed under the general project of turning eHealth networks into predictable projects. The Pan-African e-Network project Methodology This paper is the result of qualitative ethnographic research. The primary aim of this research was to understand the main factors contributing to the low utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network. The research was premised on the conviction that a proper understanding of the low utilisation of the project entailed to investigate its day-to-day practices and discourses. In order to do so, I have conducted ﬁeldwork during over 1 year, in 2010 and 2011. Fieldwork was conducted in India, Senegal, and Ethiopia. Research methods included semidirected interviews, ﬁeld observation, and document analysis. Interviews I conducted 52 semi-structured interviews with doctors, hospital managers, engineers, and politicians involved in the Pan-African e-Network. Interviewees were chosen following a non-probability sampling method. Purposive and snowball sampling methods were used. Sampling was based on the involvement of interviewees within the Pan-African e-Network. A large majority of the main actors of the project were interviewed. Interviews were conducted in English and French. They lasted between half-an-hour and three hours in length, with the majority taking about one-and-a-half hours to conduct. The interviews focused on the design, implementation, and daily operations of the Pan-African e-Network. Interviews also discussed the perceptions and experiences of the project by its main actors. They were recorded and subsequently transcribed and analysed. Field observations Field observations were carried out using a multi-sited ethnographic approach (Marcus, 1995). Observations were carried

out in 8 out of the 12 participating hospitals in India. These hospitals include Apollo Hospital (Chennai), Sri Ramchandra Medical Centre (Chennai), Healthcare Global Enterprises Ltd. (Bangalore), Narayana Hrudayalaya (Bangalore), CARE Hospital (Hyderabad), Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (Lucknow), Fortis Noida (Noida), Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre (New Delhi). Observations were also carried out at the Centre hospitalier national universitaire (CHNU) de Fann in Dakar, Senegal, and Black Lion Hospital, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Observations were carried out for periods ranging from a few days (in most cases) to several months, in the case of Apollo Hospital (Chennai) and CHNU Fann (Dakar). During these observations, I documented the daily work of engineers and doctors, paying special attention to their technical routines and clinical practices. I spent a lot of time in recording studios, in staff meetings, and attending teleconsultations and continuing medical education sessions. Observations were also carried out in other sites related to the Pan-African e-Network. These include technical centres operated by Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd (TCIL), the project’s implementing agency. Technical sites are located in New Delhi (Data Centre), and near Dakar (Satellite Earth Station), in Senegal. Observations were also carried out in trade exhibitions, and at the Second India-Africa Forum Summit held in Addis Ababa in May 2011. Field observations have made it possible to observe the interplay between the project’s various stakeholders including India’s Ministry of External Affairs, bandwidth providers, participating hospitals, and TCIL. Document analysis Field research also included the collection and analysis of documentation generated by the Pan-African e-Network. These include technical documents (maps, blueprints, equipment lists, etc.), government publications, advertising material, press releases, a web site, and two short ﬁlms about the Pan-African e-Network. Data analysis Data analysis followed common ethnographic data analysis guidelines. The ﬁrst analytic step taken was data organisation, or indexing. Contacts, recorded interviews, ﬁeld notes, and other documents collected in the course of the ﬁeld research – brochures, audiovisual works, maps, blueprints, and so on – were saved, listed, transcribed, and sorted out. Data was read over and over again. Data was then organised into abstract domains including methodological notes, analytic categories, diagrams, case studies, and theoretical notes. I then proceeded to an in vivo/emergent, open coding of the relevant data. This allowed to develop analytic themes, and to identifying the conceptual import and signiﬁcance of particular observations. Open coding involved interpreting the data while relating them to wider frameworks and broader processes. Following a widely accepted method, I then moved on to more focused coding, with particular emphasis on concepts related to low utilisation. I then came back to further phases of open coding, ensuring a balance between inductive and deductive theorising (O’Reilly, 2008). As usual with ethnographic analysis, the goal was not to achieve representativeness, but rather to identify meaningful patterns and variations (Emerson et al., 1995).

Data analysis also involved thick qualitative description of the Pan-African e-Network. This included description of daily technical and medical routines, of the network’s main sites, of various events surrounding the project, such as ceremonies, conferences, meetings, and so forth. Qualitative description also included case studies of engineers, doctors, project and hospital managers, patients, and of the former Indian President Dr. Abdul Kalam, who was interviewed for the purposes of this research. A digital clinic The Pan-African e-Network is an eHealth initiative delivering medical teleconsultations and continuing medical education (CME). Both are provided free of charge by tertiary care hospitals located in India to hospitals across the African continent, mostly public institutions located in urban centres. Both CME sessions and teleconsultations cover a dozen medical specialties and take place in studios equipped for that purpose. Broadcast live in participating hospitals, CME sessions consist of daily programs of live medical training. Every Indian hospital offers six sessions per month, covering a broad range of topics and specialties. As many as 72 sessions are broadcast every month in participant hospitals. Medical teleconsultations consist of real-time videoconference sessions between Indian specialists and their African colleagues, in which they discuss patient cases, clinical impressions, probable diagnoses, and advisable treatments. They take place in studios equipped with IT and medical equipment installed for this purpose. The network also comprises an electronic medical record system, to facilitate the circulation of medical images, and patient data. Teleconsultations take place on request. Usually, they are requested by African medical teams to address complex, challenging patient cases. Teleconsultations may be used to obtain a second opinion when a diagnosis is uncertain. They may also provide support in the therapeutic management of patients, assisting doctors who are inexperienced with performing certain procedures. Teleconsultations cover a dozen medical specialties. At CHNU Fann, in Dakar, radiology, neurology, and paediatric care are the most common. The head of the neurology department at CHNU Fann, Prof. Bara Diop, thus sums up the usefulness of the teleconsultations services: ‘The network broadens our vision. It opens it up to all sorts of possibilities’. ‘A shining example of South-South cooperation’ ‘We’re a nation of a billion people and our thought is: “What can I give to the world?” ’, explained Dr. Abdul Kalam when I met him at his residence in New Delhi. ‘We can give knowledge and take care of the world’, he continued. The PanAfrican e-Network, insisted the former President of India, was implemented as part of a broader strategy aimed at crafting an innovative, Indian contribution to international development. As the chairman of TCIL would later sum up: ‘Dr. Kalam thinks big. It was his vision. It’s the mother of all telemedicine projects’. The Pan-African e-Network has great political and economic relevance. It is a poster child for neo-liberal India, driven by technical and commercial ambitions that seek to position the nation at the heart of global development. In this regard, the project is the outcome of speciﬁc historical conditions. These include experimentations with large-scale

eHealth networks across India over the past decade (Ganapathy and Ravindra, 2009; Mishra et al., 2011); the role played by the Indian space programme in promoting ICT4D and eHealth initiatives (Bhaskaranarayana et al., 2009), and the rapid privatisation of the Indian hospital sector. Above all, the Pan-African e-Network is, as its slogan states, a ‘shining example of South-South cooperation’. As such, it illustrates the Indian state’s renewed vision of cooperation, coalescing around a revival in Indo-African trade in strategic sectors, among which the ICT and hospital sectors play a leading role (Duclos, 2012; Duclos, 2014). In sum, the state’s modus operandi in terms of cooperation is to facilitate transnational trade. In accordance with such a philosophy, the Pan-African e-Network is a public–private partnership funded by the Indian state and involving many private stakeholders such as technology providers and tertiary hospitals. The network builds bridges between the African healthcare sector and Indian service providers. For hospital chains like Apollo Hospitals, Fortis Healthcare and Narayana Hrudayalaya, which are attempting to break into African healthcare markets, the Pan-African e-Network offers a unique opportunity to promote their services. The project also provides a platform to foster the circulation of patients, as some come to India to receive treatments prescribed over the network. As such, it is widely presented as a ‘win-win scenario’ in which African doctors and patients have access to valuable expertise while Indian hospitals increase their presence in relatively untapped markets. Connecting the world The Pan-African e-Network is a bold technological initiative. In a nutshell, the network consists of a transnational nexus of landline and satellite connectivity. Hospitals located in India are linked via a ﬁbre optic network. An international private leased circuit connects both continents. Satellite connectivity, provided by the RASCOM satellite, connects hospitals in Africa. During the course of this research, I was repeatedly reminded that the Pan-African e-network is to be delivered as a turnkey solution. Both the design and the mode of implementation of the network reﬂect the ambition to rapidly connect many hospitals operating in a wide range of conditions. In this regard, satellite technology is arguably the cornerstone of the network. Easy to install, it requires no wiring and thus provides a tailored solution to connect sites regardless of their remoteness. The General Manager of the project at TCIL explains: ‘It would have been very difﬁcult to rely on landline connectivity, as it is not present everywhere. Satellite was the only means which could easily connect all the countries on the network’. The Pan-African e-Network consists of private and centralised infrastructure, monitored day in and day out by TCIL. It was conceived so as to be operational in potentially precarious conditions, for instance in hospitals with unstable power supply, poor telecommunication facilities or with a shortage of skilled labour. To overcome such barriers, the project comes with a whole system of technical support, a ‘portability kit’ including uninterruptible power supply, and an abundance of medical and computer equipment. Also, two engineers work full-time on the project in all participating hospitals. Hired by TCIL and almost exclusively of Indian origin, they execute a range of tasks such as scheduling

teleconsultations, digitalising medical data, and perfecting image and sound quality. Overall, satellite connectivity and the ‘portability kit’ enable the implementation of the project in many dispersed hospitals in a short time frame. However, such a turnkey approach comes with a risk: that of confusing the connected hospitals with rather indistinct, interchangeable sites. As the next pages will suggest, this confusion has signiﬁcant consequences as far as the effectiveness of the Pan-African e-Network is concerned. This is best illustrated by the low utilisation of the project’s services. Investigating low utilisation The Pan-African e-Network struggles to fulﬁl one of the most common expectations about eHealth projects: to deliver costeffective medical services. The primary reason for this failure is that with only a few 100 teleconsultations and a poor participation in CME sessions, the network is heavily underutilised. ‘Giving talks to tables and chairs’ ‘This is a shining example of partnership between India and Africa. The Indian expertise and medical care is being shared seamlessly with the African counterparts’ explained TCIL’s chairman, when invited to discuss the Pan-African e-Network. The network, he insisted, has nothing in common with the chaotic roads for which India is famous: ‘It is a highway between Africa and India’. This unrestrained optimism about the network’s inﬂuence on the healthcare conditions of participating countries is not exceptional. ‘It is estimated that 1 million patients and 1000 practising doctors will beneﬁt from this telemedicine service’, had for instance suggested the chairman in Bridging the Gap, a short ﬁlm funded by the Ministry of External Affairs to promote the network. In contrast with such ﬁgures, the Pan-African e-Network had, at the time this research was conducted, rather modest impacts. Two years after the network was launched, only 300 medical teleconsultations had been conducted. Similarly, attendance at CME sessions remained relatively sparse, with sessions regularly broadcast in front of limited audience. Thus, the tone of the chairman changes, when asked about the actual utilisation of the network. Suddenly, a hint of anxiety, even of exasperation, is discernible: ‘We have a problem with teleconsultations. That should be utilised more. Also, attendance to CME is low. Now the main emphasis should be towards the maximal utilisation of the network’. The majority of the project’s actors met during this research agree on one point: there is a cleavage between projected and tangible effects of the Pan-African e-Network, and it is mainly the result of the network not being used enough. For most, poor utilisation is thus an issue that needs to be tackled seriously. Prof. K. Ganapathy, the President of the Apollo Telemedicine Networking Foundation, explains: We are giving talks to tables and chairs. The utilisation is way down. I have the capacity to provide specialists for 50 teleconsultations a day! In 25 different specialities. You name it and I can get any specialist here within one hour. Poor utilisation is upsetting. It embarrasses doctors ﬁlmed by cameras that broadcast their performance in front of empty

seats. It annoys managers of the project, as well as of participating hospitals. It is the Achilles heel of the PanAfrican e-Network. Actors involved in the project cite several factors to explain its low utilisation. Lack of awareness, miscommunication, and recalcitrant doctors Lack of awareness: to know it is to use it A majority of those involved in the provision of eHealth services consider the main factor impeding the full use of the network to be a generalised lack of awareness about it. Whether at TCIL, the Ministry of External Affairs or in hospitals, lack of awareness is a designated culprit. Individuals frequently mention the low diffusion of project information. Prof. K. Ganapathy, from Apollo Hospitals, explains: ‘The Government of India has spent 250 million dollars or something like this already, but they have not spent any money on creating an awareness! This is hardly done’. Service providers lament the absence of efﬁcient communication channels with potential users. The lack of awareness is apparently not limited to the circulation of information about the existence of the project. It is perceived as inseparable from a need to educate doctors about the beneﬁts of its services. A senior executive at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, in New Delhi, comments: ‘It’s a great tool. But they’ve not been able to sell it to the people who would use it. I think it requires two hands to clap. So simply providing the solution is not enough’. Many insist on the need to convince African doctors to use the network, by giving them more information. ‘A lack of awareness is there. People have to understand what are the advantages in telemedicine’, notes a senior manager at Fortis Noida, another participant hospital. ‘We want to persuade them’! a senior ofﬁcial of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs contends. Many consider that it is now up to participating countries to ensure maximal awareness and utilisation of the network. For instance, the project director for TCIL in Africa notes: We’re trying to sell it but it takes time. It’s a new network. There is resistance from the local side but this has to be worked on. We are trying to make people understand the usefulness of the teleconsultations in particular. As far as TCIL is concerned, we have provided the network. It’s in place. About its usage, it is for the local authorities to inculcate in the minds of the doctors. The Ministry of External Affairs and TCIL implemented several initiatives to try and persuade their African counterparts. For instance, workshops were held in New Delhi, brought together over 60 hospital managers, equipment suppliers, and national coordinators from participating countries. The project also beneﬁted from signiﬁcant public exposure in the form of promotional ﬁlms, news reports, and political conferences. By contrast, most hospital managers met in participating African countries insisted that increasing awareness is not part of their mandate. As a result, participants are passing the buck on the issue of lack of awareness, recognised by all as an important factor in low utilisation. Communication barriers It is not always easy to communicate using the Pan-African e-Network. To start with, the network is arguably an English-

speaking environment. For instance, teleconsultations and CME sessions take place exclusively in English. The website, working documents, workshops, and formal activities surrounding the project also take place in English. However, English is the mother tongue of virtually none of the network’s participants, who speak Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi, Wolof, Arabic, Amharic, and so forth. In a sense, the use of English as the lingua franca ensures the cohesion of the project. Nonetheless, many of the project’s participants believe that language is an obstacle to greater use of the network. Doctors who lack proﬁciency in English apparently hesitate to request medical teleconsultations. Language barriers also affect attendance to the continuing medical education sessions. During the course of this research, many African doctors told me that they had a hard time understanding their Indian colleagues when they are giving their lectures. This was particularly the case in Senegal, where most doctors speak French, but are not used to work in English. This situation was exacerbated by strong regional accents. As was noted by a cardiologist at CHNU Fann, in Dakar: ‘Language is a primary cause of low utilisation. Doctors are not comfortable using the network’. For instance, since I am personally ﬂuent in both French and English, I was sometimes asked to translate questions and answers of participants at the end of continuing medical education sessions. This happened while I was present within the network’s studio in both Indian and African participating hospitals. While this personal involvement in translation tasks remains anecdotal, it hints at wider linguistic barriers. In sum, the decision to overcome the impressive linguistic mosaic of the territory covered by the network with a lingua franca may be affecting the use of services. In addition to language barriers, certain technical limitations also disturb the ﬂow of communication on the network. While the quality of the video is generally considered acceptable, the high latency of the satellite link produces delays in voice transmission, which affect the ﬂuidity of the conversation. A neurologist at CHNU Fann notes: ‘Communication is difﬁcult over the network. We struggle properly hearing each other’s voice. And then there is the accent. We need to make a huge effort to communicate’. On the basis of ﬁeld observations, it is indeed possible to conﬁrm that technical limitations affect discussions between doctors during teleconsultations. To put it simply, network users may need to exercise a lot of patience. However, the actual impact of technical issues on the rate of utilisation of the network should not be taken for granted. In fact, most doctors are satisﬁed with the overall quality of communication. Even when technical problems are experienced as irritants, it is not easy to assess the extent of the link between this dissatisfaction and a reluctance to use the network. All in all, technical communication issues may be a contributing factor but certainly not a decisive one. Recalcitrant doctors: ego, resistance, and frustrations At the heart of the Pan-African e-Network, there is a desire to incite clinicians to incorporate teleconsultations into their clinical practice. The project is based on the premise that it is in the interests of both doctors and patients to call upon the expertise of Indian medical specialists. Consequently, to connect to the network is considered to be a rational, logical choice, and even a form of responsibility. Expectations related to the project thus rely on the idea that potential users share

this vision of their own and their patients’ interests. However, it appears that this may not always be the case. When the time comes to make sense of the lack of enthusiasm of doctors practising in participating African hospitals, their egos are often regarded as the primary culprits. A senior ofﬁcial at the African Union Commission explains: ‘First, doctors have a big ego. They think they have nothing to learn from others’. This ego, which apparently prevents doctors from enjoying the beneﬁts of networks, is commonly mentioned in discussions on utilisation with the project’s managers: ‘The question of the ego of the doctor comes in the picture. Doctors are having this feeling that their patient might feel that they are not competent enough and that’s why they are asking somebody else’. (Chairman of TCIL) According to such narratives, as they refuse to integrate the network into their clinical practice, doctors impede the fulﬁlment of the core mission of the initiative, namely to improve the medical care of their patients. This is, in turn, generally seen as a form of resistance to change. Once again, a senior ofﬁcial at the African Union Commission explains: ‘It is threatening doctors. Maybe it would replace them. This is an issue of resistance to change’. Resistance to change thus apparently, some suggest, betrays a latent conservatism. ‘They do not like to be told what to do’, comments the project director at TCIL. Some also believe that the services being provided for free may be seen as suspicious for some. Suggestions to provide African doctors with some sort of ﬁnancial incentive to participate, or making participation mandatory are also common. Others cite vague cultural or behavioural factors including lack of entrepreneurship, lack of discipline, or ‘laziness’. Whether one speaks of ‘ego’, of ‘indifference’, or of ‘close-mindedness’, the African clinicians’ attitudes towards the network are thus ultimately interpreted by the network’s managers as a form of resistance to change. In contrast with such interpretations, interviews conducted with African doctors reveal that their reluctance to use the network has little do to with a resistance to change per se. In fact, African doctors raise grievances with the way the network affects their practice. For instance, doctors explain that while teleconsultations may sometimes be very useful, in other occasions they can foster a sense of helplessness. Sometimes, doctors insist, there is a signiﬁcant gap between the medical knowledge transferred via the network – for instance in the form of a diagnosis, of a medical treatment – and the actual possibilities that they locally have. A neurologist at CHNU Fann, in Dakar, explains: Indian specialists have access to diagnostic equipment that we do not have here. Sometimes they might suggest: ‘You have to do this.’ But we can’t! Access to medical care is very limited, for technological and economic reasons. Often patients can’t afford tests or treatments. Sometimes we already know what we should do in the best-case scenario, but we can’t do it. In these cases, teleconsultations can become very frustrating. These are the limits of the network. (neurologist, CHNU Fann) Medical knowledge is not merely circulating on the network. In order to have any therapeutic relevance, it also has to be translated (or adapted, mediated) in many different ways. For instance, participating doctors often have to adapt courses of treatment according to the local availability of diagnostic

testing or medicines. There is a lot of improvisation involved and this often requires additional efforts and time-consuming procedures. Also, medical teleconsultations produce all sorts of effects, whether direct, or unintended. Through the network, patients may for instance learn that they are suffering from a condition for which there is no treatment available locally. From the perspective of African doctors, reluctance to use the network is thus not framed in terms of resistance to change, but as a resistance to the speciﬁcities of this process of translation, and to its effects. Effects that include being confronted to the limitations of their own medical practice. In other words, African doctors claim that the actual effects of the knowledge circulating on the network in terms of patient treatment foster a sense of helplessness and frustration. This sense contributes to their low utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network. Design and implementation of the project ‘It's a question of organisation and method’, suggested the head of the cardiology department at CHNU Fann, when prompted to comment on the poor utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network. Many participants in the project have strong opinions on its design, management and day-to-day activities. According to them, the way the project was designed and implemented is to blame for its low utilisation. Field observations carried in hospitals also tend to hint at issues in this regard. Speciﬁcally, the design and implementation of the network contribute to its low utilisation in at least two respects: (a) a weak institutional integration; (b) a lack of ﬂexibility. Weak institutional integration One of the primary factors affecting the utilisation of the PanAfrican e-Network is the weak integration of the project into the participating hospitals. The Pan-African e-Network is designed to ﬁrst connect sites and then integrate them into their host institution. It is not expected to emerge from local practices, but to graft onto them. However, the Pan-African e-Network does not blend easily within participating hospitals. It is not well integrated. Field observations show that this weak integration is, in turn, directly related to what has been earlier referred to as the project’s ‘turnkey’ approach. The Pan-African e-Network is a highly standardised project. According to the project’s logic, medical expertise (for instance continuing medical education courses), equipment, schedules, and technical protocols are to be the same everywhere. As mentioned earlier, the project was designed in such a way as to be operational in any given institutional setting. This is achieved using what I earlier referred to as the ‘portability kit’ of the network. The ‘portability kit’ ensures the relative stability, and autonomy of the network – for instance in terms of connectivity, power supply, and skilled labour. However, this autonomy comes at a price: the PanAfrican e-Network is insulated from the sites in which it is being implemented. This is illustrated both in spatial and organisational terms. In every hospital visited during the course of this research, the sites of the network were spatially isolated from the hospital. The studios of the Pan-African e-Network occupy premised located outside of the participating hospitals. The studios are not shared with participating hospitals, and they are entirely equipped and managed by TCIL. They are usually located at a walking distance from regular care units. As a

result, doctors, both in India and Africa, have to walk for at least a few minutes in order to participate in teleconsultations and continuing medical education sessions. Potentially interested doctors also have to ﬁnd the studios, whose location is often peripheral and not well known. For instance, at the moment of my presence at Black Lion Hospital, in Addis Ababa, the studio was located in the basement and participants had to walk through a long and poorly lit hallway in order to reach it. In sum, while this spatial isolation may have been the easiest way to rapidly implement the network in over 40 hospitals, ﬁeld observations suggest that it is an obstacle to the institutional integration of the project. Another aspect that contributes to a weak institutional integration of the project is the choice of actors involved in its daily operations, starting with onsite engineers. As mentioned earlier, engineers were dispatched to all participating hospitals by TCIL. Having the task of building relationships with local doctors and hospitals, engineers are expected to play a leading role in the utilisation of the project. However, ﬁeld observations reveal that this is hardly the case. To start with, engineers were chosen on the basis of their technical training and skills, and not their ability to build local awareness about the project. Furthermore, being almost exclusively of Indian origin, engineers know very little about assigned sites before their arrival, and must adapt quickly. Again, this decision is dictated by a ‘turnkey’ approach, fostering Indian employment while standardising the training and work of engineers. A senior ofﬁcial at the African Union Commission recalls: ‘Nobody could interfere with India on that front because they had decided to give the network on a turnkey basis’. All in all, low utilisation is directly related to the ‘turnkey approach’ inherent to the network’s design and implementation. Far from being accidental, this modus operandi ensures the rapid expansion of the network across a whole continent and, as mentioned above, is directly related to the political and economic ambitions of the network. However, the downside of this quest for self-sufﬁciency is that the project is systematically caught in between a highly centralised management and a diversity of local conditions and institutional settings. As a result, nearly 2 years after it was launched, linkages between the network and participating institutions remain generally tenuous and unstable. Such an organisational distance is detrimental to a better utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network. Poor utilisation is, in this regard, a highly political issue. Lack of ﬂexibility Many doctors practising in CHNU Fann consider that what actually underpins issues such as the weak integration of the project, the choice of the actors involved or the absence of strong relationships between doctors is a lack of ﬂexibility inherent to the project’s design and implementation. ‘It is not ﬂexible, not customised’, a Senegalese neurologist explained when asked to comment on the fact that he is not attending CME sessions provided as part of the project, despite the fact that he regularly uses the network for teleconsultations. In fact the CME program, which is struggling to attract an audience, is often mentioned as an obvious example of this lack of ﬂexibility. First, there are scheduling conﬂicts. Doctors at CHNU Fann believe that the schedule of the CME sessions does not integrate well into their daily routine. The sessions are almost all broadcast in the morning,

while it is at this time of day that doctors visit inpatients in their respective departments. While not as systematic, scheduling conﬂicts also affect teleconsultations. However, doctors acknowledge, it is difﬁcult to avoid scheduling conﬂicts when so many hospitals are involved, each with its own schedule. Put simply, the project connects too many hospitals, in too many countries, to successfully adapt to their speciﬁc routines, practices, and needs. Underutilisation exists because there is no need-based approach, so they have to be large. These are choices that have been made and imposed. We were offered a package. We have never been asked what our needs were. Hence, we use the package according to our needs and availability. Basically, there is a mismatch in the process. Right now, it is we who must innovate to adapt the project in our context. (Prof. Diop, Head of the cardiology department, CHNU Fann) Also, the Pan-African e-Network is designed to channel communication through a centralised technical and organisational platform run by TCIL. For instance, doctors on both sides of the network never, or very rarely, meet outside of the project’s platform. An engineer in charge of the project in one of the participating Indian hospitals notes: The problem is the personal contact. We cannot communicate directly with them. Only through TCIL we can communicate. [….] But unless we talk to the local people, like we usually do with our other telemedicine networks, we cannot know what are their expectations, what is the problem there. That’s another drawback. In Africa, we don’t know whom should to contact! If we go through TCIL, the process is complicated. TCIL are working ﬁne, but there are many levels. Many forces are there. It’s difﬁcult to make things move quickly. Then again, local adaptations do not always come easily. For instance, during my research, managers at CHNU Fann sought to expand the network to hospitals located in different towns in Senegal. The proposal had a fairly cold reception from TCIL. The same holds true for equipment provided by the project, which hospitals sometimes use for different purposes. Boundaries between what is the Pan-African e-Network and what is not are not to be crossed. Then again, boundaries are constantly crossed and indeed, contested. Speciﬁcally, this ethnographic investigation of the project reveals the actual absence, in practice, of ﬁrm, stable boundaries. The next section discusses how tensions between openness and closure, immanence and transcendence, turnkey implementation and tinkering affect the utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network.

implementation. This approach primarily takes ontological and political forms, discussed in the present section. Ontological divide: technical and ‘non-technical’ domains From its design to its daily activities, the Pan-African e-Network is structured around an ontological division between technical and ‘non-technical’ domains. The Chairman of TCIL provides a striking illustration of this while discussing the low utilisation of the project: ‘Whatever attendance is there, there is nothing wrong on the part of the network itself. It is there and it works great’. While apparently innocuous, this statement speaks volumes about a conception of the network. The Pan-African e-Network, the statement suggests, is a technical tool available for the potential user. This network, most agree, works well. With few exceptions, the equipment has been delivered and installed. Engineers are stationed. Data circulates. The network is up and running. Drawing from the study of an electronic patient record (EPR) system in Denmark, Jensen (2006) suggests that such a conception of project implementation takes root in the separation of the technical from the organisational domain, which locates them in different ontological and analytical domains. As it is blind to the entanglements, in practice, of the technical and the organisational, this dichotomous conception tends to lead to a prioritisation of technical expansion over the organisational dimension of project implementation. For instance, Jensen suggests that it contributes to a systematic underestimation of the capacity of healthcare practices to change the outcomes of EPR implementation efforts. This affects the way projects’ successes and failures are analysed, as technology tends to be perceived as neutral and an extra component – ‘something intangibly “social” or “cultural” or “organisational” ’ (Jensen, 2006: 43) – is identiﬁed as the source of resistance to efﬁcient adoption. This is a common pattern in explanations of the low utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network. As explained earlier, factors like the African doctors’ recalcitrance to use it are considered as mere obstacles to the project. They are mere setbacks, or unfortunate mishaps. Anything which calls into question the design of the network, its vision of an intentional future, is systematically disqualiﬁed as some extraneous considerations. For instance, daily schedules, routines, or work conditions within participating hospitals are not conceived as integral components of the network. This is best expressed by the insistence of TCIL on the lack of awareness of the project as the main reason explaining its low utilisation. When it comes to explaining the gap between the expectations and achievements of the Pan-African e-Network, the question of awareness is indeed of paramount importance. Implying that the main obstacle to the success of the project is a misunderstanding of what it is, of its ‘essence’ and usefulness, this attention to the question of awareness tends to validate the relevance of the network in its original form. According to its designers and implementers, the essence of the project can therefore not be called into question: the tool is good, it only has to be handled it properly – to be used more. It has become common, within relevant scholarship, to indicate that network infrastructures are much more than just technical objects, and to insist on the complexity and heterogeneity inherent to their design and daily operations (Bowker, 2005; Edwards et al., 2013). If one was to frame it using Heeks’ (2002b) notion of ‘design-actuality gaps’, for instance, the

Discussion This paper aimed to investigate the low utilisation of the PanAfrican e-Network. It should now be obvious that a range of factors are involved in this situation, which compromises the effectiveness of the project. However, as stated in the introduction, all of these individual factors reﬂect, in one way or another, a dichotomous approach to project design and

Pan-African e-Network could be considered as a case in point of an information system with a large gap between project design and local user actuality – between ‘where the design wants to get us’ and ‘where we are now’ (Heeks, 2002b: 104). This is a gap between how the project was initially envisioned and designed, and the actuality of its practices and experiences – including medical rounds and staff meetings, network maintenance, budgeting, border clearance processes, the frustrations and resistance of doctors, the boredom of everyday engineer’s work, and so forth. Practices and experiences which are, in turn, embedded in speciﬁc conditions such as languages spoken, available diagnostic equipment, patients’ ability to pay for treatments, hospital structures, or time zones. It could then be reasonably, and quite convincingly, argued that the PanAfrican e-Network is embedded in contexts of all kinds (sociocultural, economic, organisational, etc.), which it in turn incorporates. In sum, it could be suggested that the gap between technical and non-technical domains ultimately reveals a lack of consideration for the various contexts in which the project is being implemented – thus resulting in a low utilisation issue. By insisting on the fact that the gap between technical and non-technical domains bears an ontological character, I aim, however, to take things in a different direction, and to suggest that the Pan-African e-Network practically and materially constitutes worlds that have a life of their own – which cannot be reduced to its relationship (a gap, or else) to an initial design, or to a given context. To fully understand the issue at stake, it may useful to remind how, for quite some time now, scholars – primarily from the STS ﬁeld – have engaged in ontological exploration of how science and technology shape or, more speciﬁcally, enact their objects in practice (Pickering, 1995; Mol, 2002; Barad, 2007). Attempting to move beyond the classical dichotomy between being and representing – or between reality and our representational access to it – these investigations focus on practices of world-making and, more broadly, on multiple modes of engagement with the world. The aim, here, is certainly not to formulate a theory of being, or to claim access to reality ‘as it is’ – as the word ‘ontology’ could otherwise suggest. By contrast, empirical studies of ontology explore how relational, multiple, ﬂuid, and more or less indeterminate practices (Law and Lien, 2013: 365) are involved in world-making processes. They aim to describe and conceptualise the crystallisation of speciﬁc objects and ontological formations – just like the Pan-African e-Network – out of inﬁnitely varied elements (Gad et al., 2015: 83). What is crucial for the current discussion is that, as Woolgar and Lezaun (2013: 323) suggest, such an exploration of how objects are ‘enacted in practices’ implies a refusal to draw on ‘context’ as an explanatory or descriptive tool: Objects do not acquire a particular meaning in, or because of, a given context; they cannot be accounted for by reference to the external circumstances of their existence. Rather, objects are brought into being, they are realised in the course of a certain practical activity, and when that happens, they crystallise, provisionally, a particular reality, they invoke the temporary action of a set of circumstances. (Woolgar and Lezaun, 2013: 324) Thus apprehended, the issue with an object like the PanAfrican e-Network is not that context was not taken into

consideration and wasn’t properly investigated and incorporated into a more context-sensitive design. It is not that designers were ineffective in matching the technology to the context it is implemented in. The issue is, by contrast, that context is conceptualised as a stable, static entity, as something that surrounds and conditions the project and its ontological enactments – as something ‘ “out there” waiting to be represented’ (Hayes and Westrup, 2012a). In other words, the issue with the ontological divide is not only that it sustains the fantasy of a pure, non context-speciﬁc technical domain – as it clearly does. It is also that the project fails to place itself in a broader context – it fails to contextualise itself, to give itself a context (Latour, 1996). Political sorting out: what is the project, and what is not The Pan-African is a project on which a great many hopes and expectations are pinned. Its aim, after all, is to illustrate what an Indian contribution to the world may look like. As mentioned earlier, these expectations translate into speciﬁc design and implementation decisions. They were most blatantly visible in the decision to connect over 40 hospitals within a few months. They were also discernible in the choice to adopt an integrated, turnkey approach. Put bluntly, the Pan-African e-Network is premised on an attempt to sort out what is the project and is not and should be left outside of it. And this an attempt with great political relevance. The Pan-African e-Network distributes medical knowledge and care in ways that reproduce and reinforce existing relations (Edwards et al., 2013). The network fosters the globalisation and the outsourcing of medical expertise and care, for instance by setting up cooperative agreements, commercial partnerships, and diplomatic relations. There is no clear distinction between the project itself, the speciﬁc conditions it is contingent on, and its direct or indirect effects. These include economic inequalities – medicine is not being practised under the same conditions in participating Indian and African hospitals – political motivations, moral and cultural values, and historical developments, among other things. However, and this where a dichotomous approach comes into play, the Pan-African e-Network is premised on precisely this notion that it should be preserved against unforeseen contingencies and forces. The project displays an insatiable quest for mastery, for predictability. This is obviously illustrated by the decision to opt for a turnkey approach. As I was often reminded, the project could not be at the mercy of local obstacles, struggles, or improvisations. A turnkey, centralised and standardised approach, was thus seen as the only solution to meet the project’s ambitious expectations. This is what a turnkey approach is all about: turning heterogeneous practices and processes into practices and events that can be accounted for and, eventually, managed. This is, unfortunately, not a new narrative for anyone interested in modern technological interventions. One can for instance think of Scott’s magisterial critique of top-down social and technocratic planning, most speciﬁcally of a hegemonic planning mentality that excludes the role of local knowledge. In Seeing Like a State (1998), Scott explains how, in order to understand the failure of so many schemes aimed at improving the human condition, one has to contrast what calls ‘high-modernist’ views with critical views that emphasise process, complexity, and open-endedness (Scott, 1998: 6).

Interestingly, Scott frames this contrast as a matter of vision and, most speciﬁcally, of legibility. Scott carefully shows how certain technologies – of naming, accounting, classifying, etc. – make certain things, and not others, visible to the eye of the State. Visible in the sense of legible, commensurable, and accountable. This is an argument which is similar to the one I have developed in the earlier section, while discussing the ‘ontological divide’. However, when framed this way it emphasizes the strong political relevance of the issue of representation, and thus of the relationship between project and context. Thinking like a state, suggests Latour in reference to Scott’s thesis, is premised on the notion that calculation could replace politics. Ultimately, the heart of the matter boils down to a matter of political epistemology, of confusion between the world and its representation: ‘The many catastrophes reviewed by James Scott in his book, have all been caused by this confusion between the map and the territory – give me the map, and I will reshape the territory’! (Latour, 2007: 5). To enquire over a public problem, insists Latour, such state thinking – or seeing, for Scott – relies on a ‘view from above’. This is a very speciﬁc way to account for the problem, to make it legible. By contrast, addressing the problem in all of its intricacies entails experimental and carefully accountable procedures of inquiries, aimed at describing, assembling, composing: it requires politics. This is obviously where ethnographic enquiry comes into play. Contrasting with the ‘view from above’ of the PanAfrican e-Network, it exposes a series of asymmetries between the network as projected and the network as it experienced in practice. This is particularly well illustrated by the low utilisation of the network. Low utilisation was not planned. Furthermore, as was discussed earlier, the Pan-African e-Network is not a ﬂexible project. It is a large, overdetermined initiative. For instance, it does not take into consideration unforeseen, local uses of the equipment provided to hospitals as part of the project. However useful they may be, such uses are not considered as being part of the network. They were not planned, project-ed. Also, the project is hardly capable of addressing special requests, be they technical (extending connectivity to other sites), organisational (schedules, etc.), medical, or else. The issue with the Pan-African e-Network, then, is not that it is too political. By contrast, it is that it has a very speciﬁc, narrow and indeed political, conception of what the project is and should be. This sorting out is enacting a speciﬁc vision of the network as a predictable, linear path towards a precise destination. The Pan-African e-Network is deﬁnitely a ‘project’ in the etymological sense of the Latin word projectum, which means ‘something thrown forth’. The issue, however, is not so much the role played by vested interests and political passions in what the network is expected to be, namely in the way it was designed and implemented. It is, in fact, the idea that the network is capable of neutralising the effects of whatever could take place ‘at the margins’ and threaten its expectations. That is to say, the conviction that it is always possible and indeed desirable to preserve projects against outside inﬂuences is no stranger to the low utilisation of the Pan-African e-Network. In sum, low utilisation is exposing the ﬂip side of a turnkey approach: to leave intact the soul of the network, its corporeality had to be sacriﬁced.

Conclusion Over the last decade or so, many studies have adopted multidisciplinary approaches to examine the complex intertwinements of technical and social worlds. While focusing on the issue of low utilisation, this paper may be considered as a modest attempt to promote a dialogue between such approaches and studies aimed at documenting the implementation of ICT4D and global eHealth projects. The Pan-African e-Network is not only a case in point of an overdetermined and rather inefﬁcient project. It is also an exemplar of the relational and embedded character of eHealth networks. Clearly, the Pan-African e-Network is not a closed entity. Rather, it may best be described as an open ﬁeld composed of heterogeneous practices, processes, and force relations – be they technical, economic, medical, or political in scope. As such, it indicates a tendency towards deepening enmeshment rather than autonomous or enclosed spaces. Speciﬁcally, it suggests that movements of enclosure through which a given project may arise are always intrinsically partial and transitory. They are not the outcome of the rational choice of effective means to achieve speciﬁc ends. Rather, movements through which a eHealth project may come to life have to do with the emergence, through repeated tinkering of spaces of care (Mol et al., 2010). This impossibility to think of projects in binary terms challenges both the modern triumphalism of technocentric emancipation and the idea that contexts may be considered as static, self-evident entities. This paper suggests that this has far-reaching consequences, when time comes to design eHealth projects. Concretely, instead of revolving around the predictable impact of efﬁciently designed projects, questions for project designers and implementers could now include: How can eHealth networks transform themselves in order to acquire functions that go beyond the expectations that went into their initial design?
