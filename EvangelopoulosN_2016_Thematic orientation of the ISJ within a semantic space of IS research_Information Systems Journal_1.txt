Abstract. This study examines research published in the ﬁrst 24 years of Information Systems Journal’s (ISJ) publication history using a thematic space of all information systems (IS) research as the backdrop. To that end, abstracts from all contributing articles published in eight prominent IS journals in the period 1991–2014 were analysed to extract a latent semantic space of ﬁve broad research areas. A two-dimensional projection of the results was used to create a two-by-two map, where one dimension represents the European vs. North American style of IS research and another dimension represents a micro vs. macro level of IS research. The ISJ is positioned in the ‘micro and European school’ quadrant. Over the course of the journal’s ﬁrst 24 years, research in the ISJ started with a relative focus on the IT artefact and IS development and gradually moved towards a more balanced position that includes a considerable amount of research on IT for teamwork and collaboration, as well as on IT and individuals. Keywords: IS research agenda, IS research trends, latent semantic analysis, correspondence analysis

INTRODUCTION

From its inception, the Information Systems Journal (ISJ) was seen as a vehicle for the promotion of certain facets of information systems (IS) research that included socio-technical views of IS, a connection with IT practice and interpretive and qualitative methods of inquiry. On the occasion of ISJ’s 10th anniversary, Avison et al. (2001) report a perception that the IS discipline has matured and that the human, social and organisational factors are accepted as equally important to the technological factors. Avison & Fitzgerald (2012) reiterate the scope of IS research they would like to see published in the ISJ, as research on the impact of information technology (IT) on people, organisations and society.

The goal of the present study is to examine the thematic structure of the ISJ against a backdrop of other major IS journals and track its relative position on the intellectual landscape of IS research over time. To that end, a latent semantic analysis (LSA) is undertaken.

METHOD

Data collection The data for this study sought to include bibliographical information, i.e. titles, author names, keywords, citation reference and abstracts, on research published in the ISJ, as well as peer IS journals. To fulﬁl this purpose, a comprehensive set of articles published in the eight journals recommended by the Association for Information Systems (AIS) senior scholars group in 2011 (AIS 2015), dubbed the senior scholars basket of eight, was collected using electronic libraries. The eight journals in the senior scholars basket of eight include (in alphabetical order) the European Journal of Information Systems (EJIS), Information Systems Journal (ISJ), Information Systems Research (ISR), the Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS), the Journal of Information Technology (JIT), the Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS), the Journal of Strategic Information Systems (JSIS) and Management Information Systems Quarterly (MISQ). EBSCO and ProQuest were used ﬁrst, but because they are known to contain a number of errors, all article data were veriﬁed using the respective publishers’ Web sites. The following categories of articles were excluded from this analysis: editorials, introductions to special issues, conference reports, book reviews, paper discussion commentaries and responses to such commentaries. In a few rare cases where guest editors have produced long articles that, rather than simply introducing the special issue, present their own contribution in a way that looks and feels like a featured article, such articles were retained. Table 1 presents a summary of collected article counts by journal. As the goal of the study was to extract high-level themes representing broad research areas, the analysis focused on article abstracts. Abstracts serve this purpose well, because they are

typically written very carefully, after their authors have made an effort to articulate their article’s contribution and its position in a perceived, socially constructed, intellectual structure of the IS discipline. Extraction of ﬁve broad IS research areas as latent semantic factors The collected abstracts were analysed using LSA, a text analytic method that extracts underlying concepts from observed instances of word usage. The analysis followed the guidelines in Evangelopoulos et al. (2012) and the steps in Kulkarni et al. (2014). In step 1, a term frequency matrix of term-by-document dimensionality was compiled. Each article abstract served as a document. Terms that appeared only once in the entire collection were excluded. Trivial English words (‘stopwords’) were also excluded. A standard list of 1730 pairs of British-spelled and American-spelled term variants was used to cross-reference the two spelling styles. Inverse document frequency term frequency weighting was used to promote infrequent terms and discount frequent terms. The terms were stemmed to conﬂate different grammatical variations of the same term. An initial pass of the analysis identiﬁed terms that explain 95% of variability in the ﬁrst 100 principal components. Those terms were retained. The term frequency matrix in its ﬁnal form contained the weighted frequencies of 1225 stemmed terms over 4827 article abstracts. In step 2, singular value decomposition was performed to extract rank-ordered latent semantic dimensions. In step 3, in an effort to reproduce the ﬁve IS research areas reported in Sidorova et al. (2008), the latent semantic space was truncated to retain the top ﬁve dimensions. LSA continued by performing the factor analysis variant of LSA (Evangelopoulos et al., 2012). In order to produce interpretable factors, the dimension space was rotated using varimax rotations. In step 4, the latent semantic factors were interpreted and labelled based on a crossexamination of high-loading terms and documents. Factor labels and related high-loading article counts are shown in Table 2.

(F04) and IT for teamwork and collaboration (F05). The ﬁve extracted factors conﬁrm the results in Sidorova et al. (2008), where the same research areas were extracted by analysing abstracts in three journals (ISR, JMIS and MISQ) using an earlier time frame, i.e. 1985–2006. Table 2 (bold-faced column) also reports the distribution of articles published in the ISJ over the ﬁve extracted dimensions of IS research. The top research area throughout the 24-year period of the study is the IT artefact and IS development, with IT and organisations being the second area.

Mapping the intellectual landscape in IS research Correspondence analysis extracts principal components from a contingency table (crosstabulation) that lists frequencies of occurrence of all levels of a row factor across the levels of a column factor. Correspondence analysis produces estimation results that are similar to maximum likelihood estimation in latent variable models (Lynn & McCulloch, 2000). Because both the row and column factors are expressed in the principal component space, the ﬁrst two principal components, to the extent that they explain an adequate portion of observed variability in the contingency table, can be used to produce a two-dimensional projection where all row and column factor levels can be placed at positions that reﬂect their relative association. Such visualisation tools are called correspondence maps. An application of these maps, called a brandattribute map, has been used by marketing researchers to identify attributes that are strongly associated with a particular brand (Higgs, 1990; Whitlark & Smith, 2001). In our case, the 5by-8 contingency table in Table 2 can be projected onto two dimensions and produce a map that associates the ﬁve research areas with the eight journals. With the research dimensions and the journals presented on the same plot, we may then be able to see how each journal has strategically positioned itself in the intellectual landscape of IS research. Figure 1 presents this visualisation.

The ﬁrst principal component explains 58.35% of variability. The second principal component explains 36.11% of variability. Because the two ﬁrst principal components together explain 94.46% of variability, we consider the two-dimensional projection to be adequate for visualisation purposes. Interestingly, all European journals have low coordinate values on component 1 and all North American journals have high coordinate values. Therefore, component 1 seems to be mainly a European School vs. North American School dimension. Additionally, research areas F01 (IT and organisations) and F04 (IT and markets) have low coordinate values on component 2 and research areas F02 (IT artefact and IS development), F03 (IT and individuals) and F05 (IT for teamwork and collaboration) have high coordinate values. Therefore, component 2 can be construed as a ‘micro vs. macro’ dimension, where, for the purposes of this study, ‘micro-level IS research’ is deﬁned as ‘research on the IT artefact, IS development and the interaction of IT with individuals and teams’, and ‘macro-level IS research’ is deﬁned as ‘research on the interaction of IT with organisations and markets’. The ISJ is then positioned in the ‘micro and European School’ quadrant. Not surprisingly, JAIS sits on the boundary between North American and European style of research.

Research area preference dynamics Table 2 and Figure 1 reﬂect an average position assumed by each journal over the entire 24year period 1991–2014. However, journal interests in various research areas have not remained constant over time. If we drill across the time dimension on Table 2 and examine the dynamic behaviour of the ﬁve research areas’ relative importance, a striking pattern emerges: a move towards equalisation of relative interest across all ﬁve research areas. For example, in 1991, the ﬁrst year of this study, research on IT artefact and IS development represented 50.45% of published research across the eight journals, research on IT and organisations represented 28.83% of published research, while research on IT for teamwork and collaboration represented a mere 1.8%. By 2014, the last year covered by this study, all ﬁve areas had converged to about equal relative interest levels, covering 21.53%, 19.10%, 18.40%, 20.14% and 20.83% of published research, respectively, in the order the ﬁve areas appear on Table 2. The ISJ exhibits a similar dynamic behaviour to that observed in the entire basket. Table 3 presents a breakdown of research published in the ISJ across the ﬁve research areas,

showing partial counts for 5-year periods. The journal’s publication history starts with a strong emphasis on research on the IT artefact and IS development, with 48 papers, or 65.75% of the journal’s publication space, relating to this area in the 1991–1995 period. Galliers & Sutherland (1991), Wand & Weber (1993) and Lyytinen & Robey (1999) are three characteristic – and seminal – papers in this area. Research in the area of IT artefact and IS development gets gradually de-emphasised to reach 19 papers, or 23.75% of the journal’s publication space, in the 2011–2014 period. At the same time, research on IT for teamwork and collaboration starts with no papers at all published in this area in the 1991–1996 period, to ﬁnish with 26 papers, or 32.5% of the journal’s publication space, in the 2011–2014 period. Staples & Webster (2008) and Davison et al. (2013) are two characteristic – and well-cited – papers in this area. Research on IT and individuals starts with nine papers, or 12.33% of the journal’s publication space, in the 1991–1996 period, to ﬁnish with 17 papers, or 21.25% of the journal’s publication space, in the 2011–2014 period. Lin & Bhattacherjee (2010) and Venkatesh et al. (2011) are two characteristic – and well-cited – papers in this area. Finally, it may be worth noting the relative shortage of research related to IT and markets published in the ISJ, a shortage that persists throughout the 24-year observation period. The information contained in Table 3 is visualised in another correspondence map, shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows that research published in the ISJ started with a sharp focus on the IT artefact and IS development (F02) and gradually moved towards a more balanced position that includes a considerable amount of research on IT for teamwork and collaboration (F05) as well as on IT and individuals (F03). Interestingly, in spite of this move, the ISJ remains in the Micro/European quadrant.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

45

Avison & Fitzgerald (2012), reﬂecting on their long involvement as the ISJ editors, see ISJ’s journey over the years as a gradual move away from ‘risk-taking’ choices and towards becoming part of the ‘establishment’, with a thorough reviewing process, the wish to make the ISJ one of the top-ranked research journals and AIS recognition being the top contributing factors. The present study conﬁrms this assessment. The evolutionary trajectory shown in Figure 2 vividly demonstrates ISJ’s convergence with the mainstream, as it tracks a movement in the semantic space of IS research from an extreme position to a much more central position, amidst an area delineated by the average positions of EJIS, JAIS and MISQ. The shift of the portion of ISJ authors located in North America from about 30% to about 40%, documented in Table 3 of Avison & Fitzgerald (2012), and the shift of the type of research from about 23% positivist/77% interpretive to about 38% positivist/62% interpretive, documented in Table 5 of Avison & Fitzgerald (2012), may partially explain this gradual transformation of the ISJ. To put it in the words of Avison & Fitzgerald (2012), the ISJ has become ‘a general IS research journal willing to publish the best IS research’. This study concludes with the caveat that semantic abstractions, projections and statistical summaries of research papers, such as the ones presented here, can never be a substitute for the deep reading of the original works.
