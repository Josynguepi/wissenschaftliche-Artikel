Abstract Multicommunicating (MC) represents a form of multitasking in which employees such as IS analysts and managers engage in multiple conversations at the same time (e.g., by sending texts while on a telephone call). MC can occur either during group meetings or during one-on-one conversations: the present paper focuses on the latter, termed dyadic MC. MC is increasingly prevalent in the workplace and is often useful in today’s business world, for example by making it possible to respond in a timely manner to urgent communications. Nonetheless, the efficacy of MC behaviors can also be questioned as they have been found to negatively affect performance and workplace relationships, as well as causing stress. During our investigations of this phenomenon, we often heard IS practitioners say ‘So what? I do this all the time, it’s no problem!’ which suggests that certain misconceptions regarding MC behaviors may be prevalent. Arising from research findings in multiple disciplines, we examine four such practitioner beliefs regarding MC behaviors: MC makes employees more accessible, it enhances productivity, it is required in most jobs, and rudeness is not an issue when MC. Further, we suggest recommendations to IS employees and managers so that they can better manage MC.

Introduction
On average, computer programmers, IS analysts, and managers spend approximately only 9 min working on a single task before they switch tasks or engage in overlapping tasks (González & Mark, 2004). A similar pattern is often seen in employee communication behaviors: that is, they are increasingly engaged in multicommunicating (MC) (Turner & Reinsch, 2007; Reinsch et al, 2008), in which an employee is engaged in multiple conversations at the same time or in an overlapping manner, such as sending texts and/or emails during a phone call. MC involves being simultaneously engaged in several communication tasks or switching rapidly between them. The present paper examines four misconceptions regarding MC – namely that MC makes employees more accessible, it enhances their productivity, it is required in most jobs, and rudeness is not an issue when MC – and provides suggestions for how to manage such behaviors. Although MC is a type of multitasking, it is intrinsically different from non-communication multitasking in two fundamental ways. First, the timing and pace of the communications in each conversation are at least partially controlled by others. That is, the timing of each utterance or message sent by others who are in the conversation with the employee is unpredictable and is not under his/her control. Second, because MC requires

balancing and managing a diverse set of social relationships in the workplace, it is a particularly demanding type of multitasking in which individuals must balance multiple conversations involving different social relationships and unpredictable timing of exchanges (Cameron & Webster, 2013). As such, it is subject to its own dynamics, challenges, and outcomes. MC has become increasingly prevalent due to the availability of cheap communication technologies that often present simultaneous, multiple and ever-present calls on employees’ attention (Wajcman & Rose, 2011), as well as due to the emergence of organizational structures that require employees to work on multiple collocated and geographically dispersed teams (Appelbaum et al, 2008). The prevalence of MC also stems from employees who constantly (and almost addictively) check for incoming communications (Marulanda-Carter & Jackson, 2012), with some reports suggesting that 55% open their e-mails immediately or shortly after receiving them (Wallis et al, 2006) and that 75% of smartphone users check them before getting out of bed (Corbett, 2013). In today’s business world, MC is often thought to be useful as it may allow employees to get more work done, such as by responding to a few emails in their inboxes during phone calls. Employees who check their emails, respond to texts, and answer calls while being engaged in other communication tasks also become more available to others who may need their input in a timely manner (Cameron & Webster, 2011). In addition, MC can also enable leveraging, or using information from one conversation to enhance another conversation, such as using a second conversation to get a status update needed for the ﬁrst conversation (Cameron & Webster, 2011). Even though MC can be useful in different ways, questions exist about its efﬁcacy: it can have deleterious effects on productivity (Cameron & Webster, 2013), workplace relationships (Cameron & Webster, 2011), and stress (Marulanda-Carter & Jackson, 2012). As such, an important question that needs to be examined is not how to prevent MC, but how to manage it so as to minimize its negative consequences. As a potential guide in that regard, we discuss four common misconceptions about MC and provide suggestions for managing them.

ﬁndings from several disciplines, including cognitive psychology, social psychology, management, and IS. Many types and ﬂavors of MC exist: that is, employees may simultaneously juggle two, three, or more conversations; they may engage in electronic side conversations when meeting with a large group of people (Dennis et al, 2010; Stephens, 2012); they may even MC with colleagues who are also engaged in multiple conversations at the same time – a type of networked MC (we would like to thank the AE for this suggestion). Although the misconceptions below could be different for other MC situations, our focus here is on MC which involves being engaged (i) in two conversations at the same time and (ii) in oneon-one, rather than group conversations.

MC makes me more accessible Thirty-ﬁve percent of information workers check their email every 15 min (Marulanda-Carter & Jackson, 2012), and our research suggests that this often occurs even when they are already engaged in another communication. Being virtually present and available to more people has become a goal of many business managers (Turner & Reinsch, 2007) and being available to others is one of the main factors that encourages MC (Stephens, 2012) in multiple management cultures worldwide (Cardon & Dai, 2014). Despite the fact the many workers believe that MC makes them more accessible, researchers have observed a paradox: although MC allows employees to be accessible or reachable (Cameron & Webster, 2011), it also makes them less accessible or available to those in the ﬁrst conversation (Cameron et al, 2012). As such, engaging in MC in order to increase one’s accessibility to some people may decrease one’s accessibility to others. MC makes me more productive Employees often MC in order to be more productive, but it is a misconception that MC always increases productivity (Te’eni, 2009). In untangling this misconception, we need to carefully consider what is meant by ‘productivity’. We use the term productivity as it is often used by practitioners; that is, to refer to performance in terms of both effectiveness (producing desired results) and efﬁciency (doing so with minimal time and effort). Although no empirical study has examined the effect of MC on the overall workday performance of employees, research examining two conversations being juggled at the same time has found that MC increases errors, reduces contributions to both of the ongoing conversations, increases confusion between the conversations, and increases the need for repetition (Cameron & Webster, 2013). Our interviews suggest that such errors can necessitate additional conversations to clarify the errors, decreased perceptions of professionalism, or signiﬁcant social rework to make up for messages erroneously sent to unintended receivers. Although studies of MC’s direct effects on speed and timing do not exist, multitasking research has observed a negative effect on speed (Bailey & Konstan,

MC misconceptions
During our investigations of MC through multiple qualitative and quantitative studies, we have often heard comments from IS practitioners along the lines of ‘So what? I do this all the time, it’s no problem!’ However, such comments and perceptions are in sharp contrast with research ﬁndings. While the four misconceptions we examine are not exhaustive, they represent the authors’ opinion – inspired by data collected over 10 years of study (e.g., Cameron & Webster, 2005, 2013) – of some of the widely held practitioner misconceptions about MC. In the paragraphs below we examine them in light of research

2006) which is exacerbated when the pace of switching between tasks is unpredictable (Adler & Benbunan-Fich, 2014), as is the case for MC. Multitasking research has also found negative effects on other facets of performance that are important for communication, such as memory (Rohrer & Pashler, 2003) and nonverbal decoding (Lieberman & Rosenthal, 2001). Additionally, people seem to often equate being a frequent multicommunicator with being able to MC well. When one is juggling multiple conversations simultaneously and becomes cognitively overloaded, the ﬁrst thing lost may be the ability to monitor one’s own performance. Research has found that those who identify themselves as frequent media multitaskers (e.g., checking email while on the phone) are actually worse than others at switching between tasks and at ignoring irrelevant information (Ophir et al, 2009). This suggests that those who MC frequently may not only be poor at MC, they may also be weak at focusing. Further, the ability to MC productively is also likely to depend on whether the goals of the two conversations are the same or different. According to cognitive psychology, two types of multitasking exist: switching between tasks with different goals and switching between tasks that have the same goal, but different means for attaining them (Marien et al, 2012). Similar results have also been reported in the MC literature: juggling two conversations about similar topics (means switching: e.g., instant messaging about project A while in a conversation about project A) is less detrimental to performance than juggling two conversations about dissimilar topics (goal switching: e.g., instant messaging about project B while in a conversation about project A) (Cameron & Webster, 2013). Thus, when the conversations are about dissimilar topics or projects, MC is particularly problematic for performance.

My job requires MC Many employees use technologies in an effort to be available and responsive to the demands of their jobs. For instance, they may have developed the habit of constantly and automatically responding to communications as they occur (such as during another conversation), rather than at a time that is best for them. As many jobs are unlikely to require such high levels of availability, employees often engage in MC due to counterproductive work habits. Consider the following: political leaders have been caught texting during speeches by heads of state (‘PM has “no recollection” of texting in front of Queen’, 2009), 1.6 million crashes a year are caused by cellphone use while driving (‘The Problem of Cell Phone Distracted Driving’), and 62% of the women and 48% of the men who responded to an online survey admitted to checking their cell phones during sex (Mosbergen, 2013). Even when a task is important, risky, or intimate, many people are unable to stop themselves from MC, with some of these behaviors becoming habits rather than being planned or strategic.

Rudeness is not an issue when MC Some of the employees we interviewed argued that MC has become a frequent and accepted behavior: ‘I think amongst my colleagues nobody really minds … I think they have a similar [positive] view because they’ve done it themselves’. In our interviews, employees have often pointed out that everyone does it at work and nobody minds. However, experimental research has found that when one observes a person who is engaged in MC, one’s perceptions of that person’s rudeness and incompetence are increased, and their willingness to help that person in the future is negatively affected (Cameron et al, 2012). These ﬁndings are particularly relevant in today’s collaborative work environments and cross-functional virtual teams where willingness to work together is integral to business success. Another often-touted belief is that only older generations view MC as rude. Although younger generations may say that they do not mind this behavior, research suggests otherwise: MC does inﬂuence how they perceive employees at work (Cameron et al, 2012). Further, employees are more likely to MC with co-workers and subordinates and believe that one should not MC with their bosses (Turner & Reinsch, 2007). However, research has found that bosses who MC are perceived to be ruder than co-workers or subordinates who MC (Cameron & Webster, 2011). This represents another myth: although employees seem to believe that MC with subordinates is preferable to MC with one’s boss, research ﬁndings suggest that subordinates are actually more bothered by this behavior from their boss. This may be because conversations with bosses are more formal and it is often difﬁcult to get their time and feedback, which might make it especially frustrating for employees who cannot have their bosses’ full attention. Finally, there is one situation in which MC may be viewed as acceptable: conversational leveraging – that is, using one conversation to provide information to the other. MC sometimes occurs when the employee in one conversation recognizes the need for additional information and initiates a second conversation to obtain this information (Rennecker & Godwin, 2005). Although not the most common reason for MC, this behavior has been frequently reported (average degree of conversational leveraging was assessed by respondents as 2.9 out of 7; Cameron & Webster, 2013). Despite the fact that MC is perceived as less rude than juggling conversations about unrelated topics (Cameron & Webster, 2011), potential rudeness may still be a key factor in deciding whether or not to MC.

What to do?
In an effort to address these four misconceptions, we provide a series of research-based suggestions for better managing MC that are focused less on eliminating MC than on gaining or reasserting control through engaging in mindful MC in a planned or strategic manner (see Table 1).

Multicommunicating suggestions

Engage in productive MC ● Engage in MC selectively by engaging in it for similar projects or topics. ● Favor self-initiated MC when it is unnecessary (e.g., by disabling ‘new email’ alerts, checking messages at set times during the workday, or closing or rendering silent other communication devices). ● Only MC when the channels for both conversations provide no visibility and at least one of the channels enables revisions. ● Be wary of overestimating your MC capacity and performance and do not confuse frequency of MC with ability to MC. Change MC habits ● Change existing MC habits that are unproductive by examining and breaking the cue-routine-reward loop. Avoid rudeness ● Only MC with colleagues and clients with whom you have established relationships and whose MC attitudes you know are positive. ● Do not assume that peoples’ attitudes towards MC are based on age or generation. ● When giving feedback and direction to employees and subordinates, focus on one conversation at a time. Analyze, discuss and modify workgroup norms ● Train employees on the relative MC strengths and weaknesses of various technologies. ● Collaboratively set ‘quiet time’ and shared expectations regarding availability and responsiveness. ● Develop channels and procedures for urgent communications. ● Regularly revisit and discuss these norms and adjust as necessary.

The suggestions include several aimed at individual employees (e.g., how to engage in more productive MC) as well as some intended for managers who want to adjust their workgroup’s MC behaviors (e.g., how to address workgroup norms).

Engage in productive MC Practice mindful MC by reasserting control over MC via a careful consideration of the similarity of conversation topics, how the MC was initiated, and the communication channels being used. Research on both multitasking (Marien et al, 2012) and MC (Wasson, 2004; Cameron & Webster, 2013) suggests that employees should engage in MC about the same project or topic, while avoiding MC about two different projects or two signiﬁcantly different topics. In addition to being less cognitively taxing, MC about similar topics can also offer opportunities for either planned or serendipitous conversational leveraging (Cameron & Webster, 2011). Mindful MC also involves favoring self-initiated over interruption-initiated MC. Research suggests that MC that arises from an interruption (e.g., an employee in a telephone conversation also responding to an incoming text) is more detrimental to performance than self-initiated MC (e.g., an employee in a phone conversation also sending a text during a lull in the conversation), as the timing of selfinitiated MC is selected by that employee (Cameron & Webster, 2013). Further, compared with self-initiated communicative tasks, these types of externally generated interruptions lead to more switches between tasks (Su & Mark, 2008). In order to limit interruption-driven MC, research suggests such actions as disabling of ‘new email’ alerts, checking messages at set times during the workday

(e.g., in the morning, after lunch, and at the end of the day), and closing or rendering silent other communication devices when they are not necessary (Marulanda-Carter & Jackson, 2012). Mindful MC also requires that the communication channels used in MC be considered. Exploratory research (Cameron & Webster, 2013) suggests that performance problems are less pronounced when both channels are invisible (such as phone and instant messaging) and at least one channel affords revisions (e.g., email messages can be reread and edited before sending). As such, email and instant messaging cannot be universally recommended for MC: for example, it would be better to avoid them during video conferencing and face-to-face conversations. Finally, we suggest that employees examine their own behaviors to ensure they are not equating being a frequent multicommunicator with being a good multicommunicator. Although a measure of MC preferences exists (Turner & Reinsch, 2004, as cited in Cameron & Webster, 2011), no measure of actual MC abilities is available. Although researchers have been developing tests regarding general multitasking abilities (Heathcote et al, 2014, for an online version of the test see http://www.scientiﬁcamerican.com/ article/test-your-multitasking-skills/), their work suggests that, other than a special category of people with ‘supertasker’ abilities (which make up less than 2.5% of the population), the rest of us generally overestimate our multitasking abilities and underestimate our errors (Watson & Strayer, 2010; Strayer & Watson, 2012). Nevertheless, it is important to note that multitasking abilities may not be directly related to MC abilities, as MC involves unpredictable timing of interactions and managing of social relationships.

Avoid rudeness Mindful MC that avoids rudeness involves analyzing the relationship with one’s MC partner. That is, it is important to note that when one is communicating with someone for the ﬁrst time or with someone one does not know well, initial impressions can be very inﬂuential. During this early stage of the relationship, the other person’s attitudes, beliefs, and values regarding MC may be unknown, and these attitudes can all inﬂuence whether or not the other person perceives MC as rude (Cameron & Webster, 2011). Thus, it can be helpful to limit MC during these early interactions. Additionally, assessing co-workers’ attitudes towards MC is likely to be more useful than simply assuming them based on their age or generation. Further, when communicating with subordinates, research suggests that the best leaders are those who provide individualized consideration – giving personal attention to and listening to other employees’ concerns (Bass, 1991). When meeting with a subordinate, this means focusing on one conversation at a time, rather than MC. Finally, explaining why MC in a particular situation is required, and apologizing for doing so, can also help minimize perceptions of incivility (Alsop, 2014). Change your MC habits Mindful MC also means carefully examining and adjusting communication habits. In the case of unproductive MC habits, the cue-routine-reward loop needs to be broken (Duhigg, 2012). A ﬁrst step in doing so would be to identify the MC routine or behavior that needs to be changed. Next, identify the cue that prompts this MC habit by tracking the location, time, emotional state, other people present, and actions that immediately precede the MC behavior. For example, an employee might discover that she/he has developed the habit of checking email during a phone call when the caller starts discussing issues that are not of interest or applicable to the employee’s job. Then, identify the intrinsic or extrinsic rewards which are driving behaviors and change their associated rewards. For example, some of the rewards obtained from responding to email during an unrelated telephone conversation may include a reduction of accumulated messages in the email inbox, a cognitive break from the current conversation, or a feeling of accomplishment for having completed something (one more email answered). Finally, when a cue occurs, try to change the loop by planning other productive behaviors which can provide the desired reward (Duhigg, 2012). Continuing with the example above, this may involve more directly addressing the issue of off-topic discussions during the phone call (e.g., helping the caller identify the correct person in the organization who should be discussing this issue). Analyze, discuss and modify workgroup norms Communication, and MC by deﬁnition, represents an interactive activity involving multiple individuals. Thus, the suggestions above would not be complete without

considering the behavior for the workgroup, rather than just dyadic interactions. As workgroups involve interdependent work patterns (Perlow, 1999), managers interested in modifying their workgroup’s MC must take a broader perspective. The recommendations above address an individual’s MC behaviors, but individuals may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to change their behavior if their job involves working interdependently with others who expect instantaneous accessibility and always-on availability. Productivity support and interruption management tools have been developed (Grandhi & Jones, 2010), but these still focus on the individual or the individual and the interrupted person without considering the workgroup’s expectations and pressures. We suggest that managers ensure that employees receive training on the tools’ MC capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses and what is expected of them in terms of their use. Future researchers and developers of these tools should likewise experiment with integrating an understanding of the workgroup needs and expectations. Expectations regarding tool use cannot be fully understood without exploring the workgroup MC norms. Although MC research has not directly studied changing workgroup norms, Perlow’s (1999) work on managing the ‘time famine’ can be insightful. Guided by her research, we suggest that managers hold discussions with their team and work with them to develop shared expectations regarding availability and responsiveness. In addition, workgroups can collaboratively decide upon ‘quiet time’ each day or each week during which time communication interruptions will be limited and an individual’s responsiveness is not expected. We extend Perlow’s work, however, by suggesting that such ‘quiet time’ may not function well without some escalation mechanism in place for truly urgent communications during that time. In earlier days, secretaries often played this gatekeeper role, protecting managers and workers from all but the most important or urgent face-to-face and phone communications (Webster, 1993, p. 117). In today’s technology-rich ofﬁce environments, developing and communicating appropriate procedures for urgent communications requires more thought and depends on several factors, such as the available technology, the nature of the work, the relationship with the workgroup’s ‘client’, and the workgroup’s spatial conﬁguration. In one telecommunications ﬁrm that we studied, email was never used as the ﬁrst option for urgent communications and employees were expected to reserve cell phone use for such situations. In another company, one employee in the workgroup was selected to monitor urgent client requests and physically ﬁnd the necessary co-worker at his/her desk when needed. Such changes are unlikely to last long-term without continual maintenance and accompanying changes to the broader work system. Perlow (1999) found that the ‘quiet time’ changes did not persist more than six months because the existing reward and incentive structures were not modiﬁed. Because workgroup needs may change, changes also need to be regularly revisited, discussed and

adjusted as necessary. In addition, learning will occur and workgroups need to experiment to ﬁnd what works for them (Perlow & Porter, 2009).

Conclusion
MC can be a powerful tool in today’s workplace and its potential value cannot be ignored. However, it also has a

darker side that is often overlooked: that is, mindless MC, rather than planned MC, can decrease productivity and degrade work relationships. Being cognizant of the four misconceptions described above and following the suggested guidelines for mindful MC may enable IS professionals to multicommunicate judiciously in support of their workplace goals.
