his paper examines how an organization’s culture, and in particular its stance toward the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, matters when confronting new digitally enabled practices for generating novel insights. We draw on an in-depth interpretive study of how two innovation consulting ﬁrms encountered crowdsourcing for innovation. Our ﬁndings suggest that, although both organizations relied on a similar set of organizational arrangements in their daily consulting work, they enacted different positions vis-à-vis crowdsourcing: one ﬁrm further experimented with it, whereas the other rejected it altogether. These different positions emerged as organizational actors examined, framed, and evaluated crowdsourcing as an alternative for generating knowledge. To interpret these ﬁndings, we draw on philosophy of science and develop the concept of organizational epistemic stance, deﬁned as an attitude that organizational actors collectively enact in pursuing knowledge. Our analysis suggests that when organizational actors encounter and explore information technology-enabled practices, such as crowdsourcing and big data analytics, they are likely to remain committed to their epistemic stance to frame such practices and judge their potential value for pursuing knowledge. This paper contributes to our understanding of encounters with, and adoption and diffusion of, new organizational practices and offers new ways of thinking about crowdsourcing.

Introduction

Under intensifying competitive pressures, organizations, especially those focused on innovation, develop speciﬁc practices for pursuing novelty and knowledge. At the same time, digital technologies enable many novel practices that promise to enhance organizational capacity to pursue new insights such as enterprise use of social media for sharing ideas (Aral et al. 2013), big data analytics (Agarwal and Dhar 2014), and crowdsourcing for innovation (Boudreau and Lakhani 2013). Like other information technology (IT) innovations in early stages of diffusion (Swanson 2012), the implementation and value of these new practices are rarely well deﬁned. Instead, organizations encounter a variety of ambiguous accounts of what these practices consist of and what they might offer in terms of generating novel insights. Thus, it is up to organizational decision makers to sort out fads from valuable opportunities (Abrahamson 1991, Swanson and Ramiller 2004), make sense of equivocal possibilities, and imagine whether

and how these new technologies may enable the pursuit of knowledge (Berente et al. 2011). Prior literature has highlighted the crucial role of organizational culture in encounters with new ITenabled organizational practices (Ansari et al. 2010, Tripsas 2009). This is true especially in the early stages of diffusion, as organizational actors explore multiple, often conﬂicting accounts of a practice and thus may pay as much (if not more) attention to their own contexts as to external opinions (Ansari et al. 2010). Scrutiny of new practices may be further intensiﬁed in situations when such practices pertain to pursuing new knowledge and innovation—traditionally seen as key for organizational competitiveness (e.g., Garud et al. 2011). Prior studies of IT implementation in organizations have highlighted that epistemic aspects of organizing, i.e., those pertaining to the nature and scope of knowledge, can become salient when diverse organizational actors are dealing with new information systems that their organizations decide to adopt

(Hedstrom and King 2006, Pentland 1995, Wagner and Newell 2004). Yet further research is needed to advance our understanding of how epistemic aspects matter when organizations encounter new IT-enabled practices and construct new possibilities offered by such practices. In this paper, we report ﬁndings from an in-depth interpretive study of two innovation consulting ﬁrms, Gamma and Delta (pseudonyms). Our inductive analysis suggests that, in developing their responses to a new IT-enabled practice for pursuing novel insights— crowdsourcing for innovation—each ﬁrm exhibited a strong commitment to a distinctive attitude toward knowledge generation. We found that such attitudes reﬂected different onto-epistemological beliefs about the pursuit of novel insights. Although both ﬁrms were similar in terms of how they organized knowledge creation, for example, relying on small collaborative teams of highly educated consultants interacting closely with clients, their constructions of, and responses to, the crowdsourcing possibility differed substantially. Gamma constructed crowdsourcing as an “alternative innovation system” relying on people not trained in suitable innovation methods and exhibited skepticism over its promise, whereas Delta saw an opportunity to invite a community of creative individuals to generate new knowledge on social challenges, and actively experimented with, adapted, and implemented the new practice. Each ﬁrm’s encounter with this new practice reﬂected commitments to distinct, organizationally enacted attitudes toward developing new knowledge. To further theorize the nature and signiﬁcant role of such attitudes, we draw on recent philosophy of science literature and introduce the notion of epistemic stance (Rowbottom and Bueno 2011a, van Fraassen 2002). We develop this philosophical notion further and propose that an organizational epistemic stance constitutes an attitude that organizational actors collectively enact in the pursuit of novel insights. Such an enacted attitude reﬂects beliefs about reality, knowledge, and the sources of novelty, and includes certain ways of investigating problems, reasoning about them, and evaluating potential solutions. We unpack how commitment to an epistemic stance was generative of new framings and constructions of crowdsourcing for innovation. More generally, we propose that when organizations encounter opportunities to adopt new IT-enabled practices for pursuing knowledge, they are likely to remain committed to their epistemic stance. The paper draws implications for using the concept of epistemic stance to study the diffusion and adoption as well as the emergence of new IT-enabled practices promising to generate novel insights, such as crowdsourcing, big data analytics, and enterprise social media.

Literature Review

An extensive body of work in information systems (IS) research focuses on the diffusion of complex IT-enabled innovations, such as entreprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) systems and, more recently, virtual worlds, and other digital innovations (Barrett et al. 2013, Berente et al. 2011, Newell et al. 2000, Swanson and Ramiller 2004). ITenabled innovations constitute bundles of new ideas, theories, and IT artifacts that promise to improve organizational performance (Fichman 2004a, Swanson and Ramiller 2004). Although there is a variety of perspectives on diffusion processes (Abrahamson 1991; DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Fichman 2004a, b; Lyytinen and Damsgaard 2001, 2011), the diffusion of IT-enabled innovations has been increasingly understood through the lens of “organizing visions” (Swanson and Ramiller 1997). According to this perspective, a community of actors, usually including technology vendors, academics, business press, candidate adopters, and implementers, collectively develop a focal community idea about how IT can be applied in organizations—an organizing vision. Organizing visions “facilitate three important aspects of the IS diffusion process: interpretation [providing information or a ‘collective account’ that explains innovation existence and purpose in relation to social, technical, and economic contexts]; legitimation [developing and propagating a rationale for adoption]; and mobilization [activating and supporting material realization]” (Swanson and Ramiller 1997, emphasis original, parentheses added, p. 460). An organizing vision perspective on the diffusion of new IT-enabled opportunities would suggest that in early stages of diffusion, there is little agreement over a focal organizing vision about such opportunities. Closer observation of related discourse communities (e.g., on crowdsourcing, data analytics, openness, etc.) in fact indicates that there is a number of diverse accounts of what such opportunities are and how they might be exploited. For example, discourse around crowdsourcing can paint it as an “efﬁcient sourcing tool,” “broadcast search” mechanism, or an IT-enabled way of accessing sticky users’ knowledge (Howe 2006, Jeppesen and Frederiksen 2006, Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010). Similarly, there is great diversity in the material artifacts used for enabling crowdsourcing, ranging from widely available social media sites (e.g., Facebook) to customized proprietary platforms, such as Dell IdeaStorm. When an organizing vision for an IT innovation is still nascent, during what innovation management scholars refer to as “the era of ferment,” multiple alternative views about the meaning and usefulness of the innovation can coexist (Kaplan and Tripsas 2008). During such times, prospective adopters (individuals and organizations) rely less on institutionalized,

“ready-made” interpretations and face fewer social pressures (Swanson and Ramiller 2004). In such times, they are likely to go through a situated process of sense making (Berente et al. 2011, Grifﬁth 1999, Weick 1995). This process is both retrospective (rationalizing actions taken) and prospective (imagining the future) (Weick et al. 2005). During such times, actors are likely to construct new frames of IT-enabled opportunities (Barrett et al. 2013, Davidson 2002, Davidson and Pai 2004, Orlikowski and Gash 1994). Beyond understanding how individual actors make sense of new possibilities enabled by IT, Ansari et al. (2010) recently synthesized the relevant management literature on how organizations encounter novel organizational practices (IT-enabled or not) and argued that organizational context plays a transformative role during these encounters. These researchers call for a closer empirical examination at the organizational level of how organizations respond to possibilities to adopt new practices. Although a signiﬁcant body of extant literature has examined how various aspects of organizational context (e.g., existing knowledge base, politics) inﬂuence organizational responses to a new technological opportunity and adoption of a new practice (Barley 1986, Boland et al. 2007, Eggers and Kaplan 2013, Kaplan 2008, Orlikowski 1996, Tripsas 2009), we have a limited understanding about the role of organizational context in potentially transforming a new practice through organization-level interpretations and enactments (Ansari et al. 2010, Swanson and Ramiller 2004, Kaplan and Tripsas 2008). Furthermore, in early stages of diffusion processes, when new practices have not acquired institutionalized meanings, the cultural universe of an organization (i.e., beliefs, values, communication styles, philosophical orientation of a whole organization) is likely to be particularly salient (Ansari et al. 2010, p. 79):
Early adopters have considerably more latitude to experiment with a practice, deﬁne it, label it, and adapt it to their local needs, implementing it in a manner that works for them.

idea that innovations, like ERP systems, can be packaged, adopted, and implemented as a uniform “best practice.” This is because various intraorganizational subgroups are characterized by diverse “epistemic cultures” (Knorr Cetina 1999). Epistemic cultures are “arrangements and mechanisms—bonded through afﬁnity, necessity, and historical coincidence—which, in a given ﬁeld, make up how we know what we know;” they “are cultures that create and warrant knowledge” (Knorr Cetina 1999, p. 1). When it comes to adopting IT-enabled best practices for sharing and capturing knowledge, challenges may arise because of the diverse epistemic cultures of various groups comprising an organization. Such groups may disagree with underlying onto-epistemological assumptions behind these new “best” practices (Wagner and Newell 2004). Similarly, in the context of digitalization of science, Dougherty and Dunne (2012) found that new collaboration challenges emerge as established scientiﬁc groups working within long-standing epistemic traditions needed to work together with a new group, “digital scientists,” who had developed a distinct epistemic culture and practices encompassing novel digital technologies. Although we have a good understanding of the role of epistemic cultures in political processes of adopting or rejecting new IT-enabled practices, more research is needed to investigate how epistemic aspects of organizing matter when it comes to framing, evaluating, and potentially adapting such practices in early stages of diffusion.

An Epistemic Stance Perspective on Understanding Organizational Encounters

Although we know that the cultural context is important, we do not yet have a nuanced understanding of how it matters during early stage encounters. Epistemic aspects of organizing when encountering novel practices. A handful of studies (Dougherty and Dunne 2012, Pentland 1995, Wagner and Newell 2004) have started exploring epistemic aspects of culture when diverse organizational actors face new IT-enabled practices. These studies stress the role of organizational actors’ epistemic beliefs and associated practices when interpreting and adopting new information systems. Drawing on an in-depth investigation of ERP system design and implementation in a university, Wagner and Newell (2004) problematize the

In this section, we develop the analytical perspective of epistemic stance, which is grounded empirically in our interpretive study of two innovation consultancy organizations, and informed by recent developments in the philosophy of science. We were prompted to develop such a perspective because our analysis highlighted that when the two consultancies we studied encountered opportunities for crowdsourcing innovation, they both exhibited commitment to their distinctive attitudes toward the pursuit of novelty as they did in everyday innovation projects. We found that this inductive ﬁnding about organizations’ active commitment resonated with the concept of epistemic stance recently developed in the philosophy of science literature (Bueno 2015; Chakravartty 2011, 2015; Ratcliffe 2011; Rowbottom and Bueno 2011a, b; Rowbottom 2005; van Fraassen 2002, 2004, 2011). This concept is “concerned with the generation of knowledge” (Chakravartty 2015, p. 176) and helps us unpack organizational approaches to innovation and the generation of novel insights.

The philosophical concept of stance is congruent with the sociological concept of “epistemic culture” (Knorr Cetina 1999), because both concepts valorize the role of values in epistemic practice. Yet the notion of stance places more emphasis on the active commitment to certain ways of knowing in dealing with a speciﬁc issue than on the stable, systemic, and material context of scientiﬁc practice foregrounded by the notion of epistemic culture. This emphasis on enactment and commitment better equipped us to conceptualize how epistemic aspects of organizing matter in encountering and constructing new IT-enabled possibilities to generate knowledge. The concept of stance has been recently developed and debated (Rowbottom 2005; Teller 2004; van Fraassen 2002, 2004) in the ﬁeld of philosophy of science (for a summary of the evolution and different interpretations of this concept, see Rowbottom and Bueno 2011a). Our analytical efforts are primarily informed by those philosophers of science who focus speciﬁcally on epistemic stance as an enacted attitude toward pursuing knowledge (Chakravartty 2011, 2015; Rowbottom and Bueno 2011a, b; Rowbottom 2005; Bueno 2015). In particular, epistemic stance is an attitude taken in relation to domains of enquiry, epistemic models, theories, propositions, etc., as well as evidence and, more broadly, any epistemic issues, i.e., whenever we face uncertainty over how to gain knowledge about the world. This attitude reﬂects beliefs about the nature of the world and how to develop knowledge about it—what philosophers call onto-epistemological beliefs (Rowbottom 2005, Chakravartty 2011). Table 1 summarizes the main dimensions of the epistemic stance concept. An epistemic stance is expressed through certain modes of generating and evaluating knowledge. A mode of generating knowledge includes the actions of selecting domains worth investigating, and rejecting other domains, as well as identifying promising areas for gaining new insights within a chosen domain. It also involves ways of investigating, such as being closer to

or detached from empirical phenomena, and experimenting with or contemplating ideas (Rowbottom and Bueno 2011a). Generating knowledge also involves invoking a certain style of reasoning, for instance, deductive or inductive reasoning, and using certain “inferential devices,” such as diagrams, models, or simulations (Bueno 2015). A mode of evaluating knowledge includes being more or less skeptical/critical toward certain types of propositions—for example, theoretically deduced hypotheses versus empirically developed ones—as well as making judgments on knowledge claims and supporting evidence. To summarize, epistemic stances “do not make claims about the world per se, but determine how agents go about making claims about the world. Stances are not believed, but adopted, held, and expressed in human action” (Chakravartty 2011, p. 38, emphasis in original). We offer an example taken from the domain of science to illustrate these ideas. Consider how a theoretical physicist enacts a speciﬁc epistemic stance when developing new theories. For the theoretical physicist, science is not about empirical content, as it would be for an empirical physicist. Instead, it is about challenging common sense and previous theories that deﬁne what is or is not worth investigating; indeed, she is likely to reject altogether empirical physics as a domain of inquiry. The starting point for thinking about a problem is not an empirical observation, but previous theories. In other words, candidates for knowledge are not phenomena but speciﬁc theories. When developing a new theory, she tries to investigate the conceptual structure of different theories that might be empirically successful, and understand whether they are conceptually contradictory. She employs a deductive and critical style of reasoning that is part of her stance about physics. Furthermore, philosophers of science stress the importance of commitment when taking an epistemic stance (van Fraassen 2002, 2004). Commitment to a stance is expressed through certain spontaneous reactions and emotions such as insisting on a particular mode

of investigation (e.g., being critical about a priori theoretical assumptions), being keen on a particular mode of reasoning (e.g., deductive or inductive), and reacting to proposed knowledge claims (e.g., rejecting blatantly knowledge that was not arrived at in a scientiﬁc fashion). Commitment is usually implicit; it “is a background framework through which one thinks about things” (Ratcliffe 2011, p. 123). It is often “prereﬂective,” that is, we do not ﬁrst think what we should be committed to, and then decide to do so; commitment just happens. Yet when we are asked to critically examine our commitment, we may offer reasons about why maintaining our particular stance is advantageous for pursuing new knowledge. The concept of epistemic stance, as deﬁned by philosophers of science, allows us to propose an analytical lens to explain Gamma’s and Delta’s distinctive attitudes toward innovation and how such attitudes might reﬂect certain onto-epistemological beliefs. In the case of an organization, an epistemic stance constitutes a collectively enacted attitude toward the pursuit of knowledge, which reﬂects beliefs about reality and the “true” sources of novelty, and is expressed through certain modes of pursuing and evaluating knowledge. This concept enables us to unpack how an organization, for which the pursuit and creation of knowledge is crucial, responds to and enacts possibilities offered by new IT-enabled practices.

possibilities to organize their work differently. Second, crowdsourcing for innovation was far from recognized as a successful organizational practice at the start of our research, with little institutional pressure to adopt it. This allowed us to better observe and examine the role of organizations’ cultural universe during encounters (Ansari et al. 2010). 4.2. Methods We conducted open-ended interviews and observations as well as an examination of archival data to develop interpretive longitudinal case studies (Walsham 1995b) (see Table 2). Data were collected on (1) the practices Gamma and Delta enacted for projects focused on generating novel solutions for their clients’ problems, and (2) the actions and responses of Delta and Gamma regarding opportunities to crowdsource innovation. Upon securing access to Delta and Gamma, we split data collection efforts for each site, with two of the authors separately collecting most of the data for each site. Another author, who was not involved in ﬁeldwork at these sites, was actively engaged in collecting published documents (articles, books, blogs, and videos) about each of the companies. At Delta, the ﬁrst author collected most of the data over three years through a series of openended interviews (26 in total) with Delta consultants, founders, and community managers of DeltaCommunity (a pseudonym for the crowdsourcing platform designed by Delta) as well as DeltaCommunity members and sponsors of publicly posted innovation challenges. All interviews were 60–90 minutes on average and were recorded and transcribed. The ﬁrst author ﬁrst interviewed three Delta consultants involved in the development of DeltaCommunity and the platform’s two community managers. She then used a snowballing technique to progressively select the remaining 21 interviews. Interviews focused on understanding Delta’s work practices on client projects and its approach to innovation, as well as the origins of the platform and the work practices enacted by the Delta consultants working on DeltaCommunity challenges. These interviews were complemented by half a dozen visits to some of the Delta ofﬁces, as well as participation in workshops and events organized by Delta. These observations—when compared with analysis of public documents describing Delta’s work—allowed us to develop a deeper understanding of Delta’s approach to innovation. The ﬁrst author also engaged in three years of participant observation on DeltaCommunity. She took part in most challenges on the platform from September 2010 to December 2013, either as a participant or as an observer on the client side. The participation in the challenges and the regular conversations with the DeltaCommunity team, with whom she developed a relationship and had regular

Research Design and Methods

4.1. Research Setting To form an empirically grounded understanding of how organizations encounter new IT-enabled practices focused on knowledge, and, in particular, what aspects of the cultural universe matter in these encounters, we studied two innovation consulting ﬁrms, for which the pursuit of novel insights and knowledge is of strategic importance. The ﬁrst ﬁrm, Gamma, is an innovation consultancy with ofﬁces in the United States and Europe that offers technical innovation consulting services to major multinational companies and works on a wide range of consumer and industrial products and processes. The second ﬁrm, Delta, with ofﬁces in the United States, Europe, and Asia is a leading international innovation consultancy working on a wide range of projects, including new products, brands, and services. We selected these particular ﬁrms for a number of reasons. First, Gamma and Delta were experts at innovation and were aware of emerging new practices in their ﬁeld, such as crowdsourcing for innovation. Selecting such “extreme cases” (Flyvbjerg 2011) (in terms of their focus on pursuing innovation) enabled us to more clearly observe how knowledge-creating organizations encounter and construct novel IT-enabled

informal conversations, provided key insights into how and why DeltaCommunity had been originally conceived by Delta, as well as into Delta’s ways of working. For Gamma, data were collected by the third author, involving 18 in-depth interviews with all key personnel in the U.S. ofﬁces, nonparticipant observations of 17 meetings on a ﬁve-month-long client project, 21 additional interviews with client team members, and six interviews with Gamma team members. Interviews were also conducted at a European ofﬁce with line consultants as well as with members of Gamma’s IT department. In total, these 51 Gamma-side and 21 clientside interviews, which were conducted in an openended fashion, focused on understanding Gamma’s work practices on client projects and its approach to innovation, as well as its response to crowdsourcing. In addition, we collected industry reports and analyses that Gamma’s managers referred to when developing their response to the crowdsourcing opportunity, and Gamma’s own presentations articulating their response. We used an interpretive approach (Orlikowski and Baroudi 1991, Walsham 1995b) to analyze our data and create an account of how Gamma and Delta encountered crowdsourcing. In addition, we adopted a view of organizations as “interpretation systems” (Daft and Weick 1984). Hence, when we speak of organizational interpretation we mean “interpretation by a relatively small group at the top who bring together and interpret information for the system as a whole” (Daft and Weick 1984, p. 285). Especially useful insights came from comparing the two cases. There were three main phases of analysis, in which all three authors participated. The ﬁrst phase involved multiple readings of interview transcripts, ﬁeld notes, and documents by all authors, separately and then in concert, with the aim to develop a holistic understanding of each organizational setting. For both organizations, all authors worked together to develop a narrative account (Pettigrew 1990) of how organizational actors in the two ﬁrms worked with clients—e.g., how they approached the innovation

tasks, what steps they took, and what activities they enacted on client projects. In parallel, we conducted analysis of publicly available material (e.g., papers, books, video lectures), which were often addressed to prospective/potential clients, with the aim to develop key themes in how Gamma and Delta approached innovation. In this phase of the analysis, we found that both Delta and Gamma expressed strong yet strikingly different attitudes and beliefs about what constitutes innovation and how to generate novel insights. Our analysis suggested that public accounts were deeply intertwined with the actual activities of innovating. Delta consultants’ publicly expressed position, for example, that “the world is a source of inspiration,” was enacted on client projects and had in fact a very material meaning by way of offering a general guide for actions. In a second phase, we focused on how the two organizations, Gamma and Delta, encountered, framed, and responded to the possibility of crowdsourcing for innovation. During this phase, we explored whether technology (i.e., technological systems, organizational routines), culture (i.e., values, beliefs), and politics (i.e., interests, power structures) might have played an important role during Gamma’s and Delta’s encounters with crowdsourcing. Although, undoubtedly, both organizations were characterized by particular technological and political conditions, data analysis revealed that technical and political speciﬁcities were less salient forces in such encounters than cultural aspects were. It was, in particular, Gamma’s and Delta’s commitment— expressed through the actions of the senior management team—to distinctive views of where new insights came from that appeared in our analysis as key. A recurrent theme was that Gamma’s and Delta’s members examined the crowdsourcing possibility by referring—often explicitly, other times implicitly—to their attitudes and approaches toward the pursuit of novel insights. In a third phase, data analysis focused further on clarifying the nature of commitments to certain attitudes and how these commitments made a difference in the way Gamma and Delta responded to such

possibilities. Our analysis was premised on a practice perspective (Feldman and Orlikowski 2011) and accordingly examined attitudes toward innovation and associated commitments as relational, performative, and enacted in concrete situations. This examination was enhanced by drawing on recent work by philosophers such as Rowbottom and Bueno (2011a, b), which develops the concept of epistemic stance to describe how philosophers of science and scientists go about pursuing and evaluating new knowledge. Consistent with a practice perspective, the concept of epistemic stance conceives attitudes toward knowledge, which reﬂect beliefs about the world and the pursuit of knowledge, as performative, that is, emphasizes situated action. This perspective informed our analysis and allowed us to enrich interpretations of the role of Gamma’s and Delta’s attitudes toward innovation in their encounters and responses to crowdsourcing for innovation. Furthermore, in the spirit of interpretive research (Walsham 1995a), we were sensitized by the notion of stance as a concept, which “opened up” a new way of diagnosing and understanding observed phenomena. This concept offered “a new lens for viewing or explaining the world” (Gregor 2006, p. 613), rather than a positivist framework enabling prediction and testing of certain relations among measurable constructs. In §5, we present the ﬁndings of our research in two main sections: we ﬁrst describe how Gamma’s and Delta’s work practices reﬂect distinctive epistemic stances; then, we discuss how Gamma’s and Delta’s commitment to distinctive stances shaped their encounters, constructions, and emergent positions vis-à-vis crowdsourcing for innovation.

Findings

Gamma Innovating through an “algorithmic” approach. Gamma prided itself on its unique approach to innovation that was applied to a wide range of problems, from “potato chips to computer chips.” At the core of this approach was the deliberate effort of Gamma consultants to probe all kinds of problems as engineering systems (sets of interacting components converting inputs into outputs and possessing certain properties) in need of major or minor improvements. Gamma’s approach had, over the years, generated numerous novel ideas for products and processes, many of which had eventually been implemented by clients and led to successful product launches and improvements in manufacturing processes. Gamma’s founders were heavily involved in developing engineering innovation methods such as TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), principles of technology evolution, and root-cause analysis for solving innovation problems in science and technology. TRIZ, which was particularly important to them initially, was a method for

systematically analyzing technical problems to reveal contradictions in functional requirements of the solution and address these contradictions through a codebook of heuristics (TRIZ) (Barry et al. 2015). They founded the ﬁrm based on their experience and conviction that “a deliberate and rigorous methodology” would consistently give better innovation results than the efforts of untrained inventors. Thus, Gamma’s founders had developed and continuously evolved a cohesive “algorithmic” approach to innovation problems, which referred to a disciplined application of a sequence of codiﬁed tools and techniques custom tailored for analyzing a speciﬁc problem and generating novel insights. The Gamma methodology for innovation was taught to all newcomers, who were selected from among the brightest engineers and scientists whose experiences and degrees typically spanned diverse technical ﬁelds. Gamma’s job applicants had to pass multiple tests aimed at assessing whether their style of reasoning might ﬁt Gamma’s approach. For example, a recent hire, Sophia, who had a master’s degree in physics and a doctorate in biochemistry, told us that she was asked to solve a number of brainteasers when she was applying for a job at Gamma—an activity that she enjoyed very much. According to the chief methodology ofﬁcer, these screening tests had been intentionally created to test whether a candidate could analyze problems in abstract terms, identify “contradictory system requirements,” and ﬁgure out an elegant solution that resolved the contradiction instead of settling on a compromise. Once hired, scientists like Sophia went through further numerous courses to learn intricacies of the methodology until they were eventually certiﬁed as senior methodology experts, usually after a period of about three years. Yet, even after their certiﬁcation, Gamma consultants kept learning new techniques. In particular, some techniques were based on counterintuitive language and abstraction tools requiring years of “unlearning” how a typical engineer or a layperson would approach a given situation. Gamma consultants and managers were so strongly committed to the Gamma approach that in those instances when a brilliant consultant “simply invented” a solution to a client’s problem, she was still asked to follow a prespeciﬁed “algorithm” so as to validate that no better solution existed. Indeed, for a solution to count as valid, it had to be derived from a systematic path of investigating the problem. Several young consultants admitted that they used a “brute force” approach to the problem on occasion, but insisted that they had internalized the methods and used them implicitly. While we were observing how Gamma worked on one of the client projects, a manager remarked that he was hesitant to assign one of the senior consultants to this project because the manager considered him to be

“an intellectual powerhouse” and was afraid that this consultant would attack the problems head-on without following the algorithm. When investigating a problem, Gamma’s consultants focused ﬁrst on analyzing and representing the engineering system to be redesigned in an abstract way to understand the “root causes” of a problem. They expressed signiﬁcant skepticism toward problem statements formulated by clients, arguing that those statements were usually misleading because of client’s “psychological inertia,” that is, the tendency to think in familiar, narrow ways. They maintained that by properly analyzing the engineering system, one could ﬁnd the “real problems” to be solved. For example, a pizza-packaging problem was reformulated as a problem of redesigning a system of material components used to hold an object while preserving its texture and temperature, lowering material costs, and improving efﬁciency. When reasoning about the problem, Gamma consultants maintained that reformulating the problem in abstract terms (e.g., functions and technological principles used) was crucial for arriving at novel insights. For example, on another project involving improving the effectiveness of a laundry detergent, Gamma consultants reformulated the function of the detergent as separating dirt from a fabric surface. Conceptualized this way, they reformulated the deﬁciency of the chemical process as one of separating the original color from the fabric, thereby damaging the article. Once a system was understood in these terms, consultants identiﬁed other technological principles for separating materials—in this case, dirt and fabric—that are more precise than chemical processing, for example, using ultrasonic waves. Repeated observations of Gamma’s projects further suggested that a key inferential device used by Gamma consultants for identifying solutions was analogical reasoning, which involved searching for a “readymade” solution to a “functionally equivalent” problem in other areas of science and technology. One of the senior managers in the European ofﬁce, Peter, who has practiced the method for over 25 years, explained how this device was often used:
Instead of looking at the lamp, or a computer mouse, or a monitor, we look at a set of functions. By translating the problem into the [most elementary] bird’s language, which is not tied to the speciﬁc object, we start looking for solutions that perform the same functions in other related ﬁelds. With 80% of the problems that we get from clients, humanity has already come up with everything. We do not need to invent a bicycle. It is already invented. We just need to take it and adapt it.

if there was evidence that it had reliably solved a functionally equivalent problem in the past. Of course, the solution still needed adaptation, virtual or even physical prototyping, and scientiﬁc experimentation to further prove the viability of proposed approaches. On the whole, adapting was still much preferred to “inventing”—a word that carried a strong negative connotation at Gamma because it denoted an ad hoc, subjective, accidental process, rather than a disciplined search for already workable solutions. One of Gamma’s top managers expressed a sentiment shared by the majority of our informants, namely, that “functional thinking represents a powerful new lingua franca that makes boundary crossing more effective and efﬁcient for research and development (R&D) and innovation teams.” Peter elaborated on the importance of following a systematic path when applying this new language:
The innovation process is like an assembly line I ﬁrst need to specify what I need at a functional level, then I generalize the function; there are 39 ways to generalize functions. Finally, I make connections I ask: for whom [in which industry] is it crucial to master such a function?

The focus on “borrowing” existing solutions was also characteristic of Gamma’s mode of evaluating insights: a solution was considered more likely to work

Gamma’s path of investigation required a wide breadth and depth of knowledge in diverse scientiﬁc and technological domains. With just over 100 consultants trained in “algorithmic” methods and organized in small teams of broadly educated scientists, Gamma could not achieve this breadth and depth internally. Thus, Gamma had been investing and frequently experimenting with IT-enabled ways of tapping into external expertise. For example, on a project focused on protecting a product from being counterfeited, we observed how Gamma’s consulting team ﬁrst reformulated one of the subproblems in terms of detecting imperfections on a material surface. They then worked closely with Gamma’s “Information Center” to use a proprietary IT tool for quickly scanning multiple patent databases and identifying patents relevant to the problem at hand. The patent search relied heavily not only on the tool but also on the Information Center staff, who were deep experts in Gamma’s methodology and could identify relevant patents in distant areas. On that project, they identiﬁed as relevant some patents from the ﬁeld of optics, which, at ﬁrst sight, had little to do with counterfeiting. Although four consultants working on this problem already covered a great range of technical knowledge in material sciences and physics, they still needed deeper expertise about speciﬁc technologies that were identiﬁed through the patent search. For this purpose, they worked again with the Information Center staff to identify external experts with subject matter expertise on technologies identiﬁed through patent search. Over many years, Gamma’s Information

310

Center had developed a proprietary database (“global expertise network”) comprising more than 6,000 outside experts who could be contracted on an as-needed basis to educate Gamma about the latest scientiﬁc or technical information in their areas. Because the role of these experts was to report on their expertise and not to address a client’s problem directly, they did not need to be trained in Gamma’s algorithmic methods. Once the consulting team received input from subject matter experts, they then “translated” these insights to the client’s problem at hand. On that project, they ended up integrating several solutions from diverse technological domains ranging from money forgery to instrument engineering to propose a novel approach to the client. To summarize, Gamma’s faith in an “algorithm for innovation” and its ability to break down a problem, often to get to the level of basic science, reﬂected an onto-epistemological belief that the material world consists of stable “objective” components that perform functions and interact with other components. Although Gamma’s approach was focused on the domain of engineering systems and explicitly avoided problems that involved a “human component,” it implicitly reﬂected the notion that human uses of technology were driven by the functional features of technology. In spite of their diverse backgrounds and possible variations in their everyday work, Gamma’s consultants repeatedly expressed commitment—both when interviewed and observed in action—to the attitude shared by organizational actors on how to best go about developing novel insights: Gamma’s stance. In Table 3 we brieﬂy summarize key dimensions of Gamma’s epistemic stance. Delta Innovating through a “human-centered” approach. Delta consulting work was grounded in the fundamental assumption asserted by all of our informants that truly innovative ideas were inspired by a deep understanding of users’ lives combined with the use of the principles of design to innovate and create value. In their consulting projects, Delta focused on developing innovative solutions that fulﬁlled people’s needs and supported their practices in various ﬁelds, such as healthcare, education, and ﬁnancial services. To ﬁnd solutions to a multitude of projects across domains, Delta had developed an innovation process, which was human centered, iterative, and collaborative and followed three general, iterative steps: “discover,” “design,” and “implement.” This process represented, for the Delta consultants we interviewed, the “DNA” of innovation. This process, claimed one of the cofounders, could be applied to a broad range of products and services: a new toothbrush, a medical device, airplane seating, banking, or educational experience. Although there was a strong belief in the innovative potential of following the process, there was also an agreement

that the process in practice was not as “clean” as on the visuals presented to clients. On the contrary, it was “messy” and nonlinear, and it was acknowledged that Delta consultants needed to be open to ambiguity and ready to adjust the innovation process to the speciﬁc situation of a project. Hence, John, a Delta consultant, explained that when he joined Delta, he needed a couple of weeks to “get used to the apparent chaos” and to come to grips with, what was in fact, a methodical way of doing things, crucial to generate novel solutions. Delta consultants organized their work in small, interdisciplinary project teams, including people from various backgrounds such as engineering, interaction design, psychology, ethnography, and business, to develop multiple perspectives, which was at the heart of their mode of investigating client projects. Delta consultants were in fact selected for their ability to work with different disciplines and manage the ambiguity involved in the Delta innovation process. One consultant explained:
No matter what your background, no matter what industry you come from, and really no matter what kind of skill sets you have, you can ﬁnd a ﬁt in the innovation team you can bring your specialty and make a contribution to that design process.

Delta designers learned the Delta process by working on a couple of projects with more expert consultants because it was believed that learning by doing was the best way to become familiar with the process and learn how to balance their in-depth knowledge and expertise with others in a collaborative dialogue. Each project was run in an extreme collaborative fashion because there was a strong belief that the best ideas came up from conversations and productive merging of different perspectives. For example, when working on a ﬁnancial service project, the ethnography expert on the team provided a rich understanding of the interactions of the customers with the bank employees as well as customers’ perception of savings. The business expert on the team, on the other hand, understood better the process between the different departments in the bank and the constraints to be taken into account while redesigning the service. The two interaction designers, in turn, brought in their personal experience with ﬁnance during the research phase and brought in their expertise during the ideation phase when they designed a new website and application. Our informants emphasized how important it was to always start by exploring users’ needs and their speciﬁc contexts and unveil their emotions and speciﬁc points of view. Chris, a Delta consultant, noted that users were the experts of their local context and insisted that the only way for her to investigate users’ needs was through immersion in that context. For example, on a

Gamma’s Epistemic Stance

Gamma Focused on improving the functioning of existing and creation of new engineering systems.

Examples of supporting evidence from interviews and ﬁeld notes During our period of study, Gamma worked on a wide variety of projects involving improving efﬁciency of industrial part manufacturing, creating green technologies, developing new medical devices for home use, and developing new counterfeit measures. Each problem was modeled as an engineering system with certain deﬁciencies that were not resolved optimally. Gamma managers were also clear on what domains they did not focus on such as those that required understanding of “human factors.” A senior European manager explained, “Adoption of the solution. That is not us. That’s somebody else’s specialty.” • “Now that I have been exposed to this structure [Gamma’s method], I see the world differently. I see shortcoming everywhere [laughs], and automatically I start thinking of how to do things better.”—Senior manager, Europe. • “The world is “functionally-ﬂat [ ] Systems operate for the sake of performing functions and our approach focuses on the original functional need.”—Senior leader, United States. • Excerpt from Gamma methods manual: —“All products and technologies evolve according to common [trends] (these trends are objective and can be predicted)—markets and technologies are dynamic.” —“A functional approach is critical to determining the right problem(s) to be solved.” —“Many key problems have already been solved in other industries and solutions can be adapted.”

We often keep asking, ‘Why is it happening this way?,’ and then we end up deep into physics or chemistry. This together with functional approaches allows us to look for solutions outside client’s ﬁeld. This is why they like us. That is also the only way we can win.

We ﬁnd the best existing system in the world for solving this problem using our patent search technology and scientiﬁc literature.

Style of reasoning: patterns of inference used to obtain relevant results

• To solve a problem one uses deductive reasoning to reformulate a problem by applying abstract/codiﬁed language used for modeling engineering systems (functional analysis) or used in basic science (chemical formulas, physical laws). • Many codiﬁed inferential devices each containing several dozen steps (TRIZ, root cause analysis, etc.) are used to reformulate the problem and search for a solution. • Analogical reasoning comparing a given problem/solution to other problems/ solutions is key. • Cross-pollination across various disciplines helps spot functionally equivalent solutions.

project for a breakfast cereal she was working on, she spent several weeks having meals with a few families to understand their lifestyle and eating habits. During this phase, a lot of important insights emerged on eating patterns and narratives around breakfast. In one case, the kids ended up eating some of their packed lunch at recess because, despite the fact that their parents thought they had consumed a good breakfast, they did not really eat and were hungry. This led the team to redeﬁne the problem in light of users’ practices rather than simply believing what others said about such practices. Delta consultants always tried to start a project with a broad divergent approach and be open to any surprising insights. Thus, when starting a project, Delta consultants ﬁrst critically examined the brief provided by clients, and then interrogated the scope of the project by remaining open to the possibility that the original problem might need to be redeﬁned. For example, when asked by the management of a hospital to redesign the reception area of the emergency room (ER), Delta consultants decided to start with an in-depth investigation of the whole “check-in experience” for all different users— patients, family, nurses, doctors, and ER drivers. The research phase included multiple activities such as shadowing some of the nurses and doctors, as well as ER drivers, getting admitted in the hospital, observing the reception area, and interviewing patients, families, and hospital personnel. The insights that emerged during the research suggested that redesigning the reception area was not sufﬁcient to transform people’s experiences. The team embarked on redesigning the whole admission process. A crucial part of doing research was not only to describe and understand current user practices but also to imagine new ways of looking at the problem to generate innovative solutions. As one Delta consultant

put it, research was for inspiration, and not for developing theories like social scientists. Research insights aimed to inspire Delta consultants and trigger ideas for new products and services. Hence, although research insight was a crucial starting point, there was also a common understanding that one should trust her intuition when generating new solutions. More than facts, research insights were described as clues and hunches that unveiled innovation opportunities and helped Delta consultants come up with “how might we ?” or “what if ” types of questions. When assessing potential solutions and the value of ideas, Delta consultants always prototyped their ideas—whether with a storyboard, a physical artifact, or through role plays. Several of our informants pointed out that an idea was “good” only if it solved a user’s problem, and the ﬁrst way to test it was through prototyping, even in a “quick and dirty” fashion. For Delta consultants, a potential solution was evaluated on the basis of whether it was accepted (or likely to be accepted) by users as addressing their needs and supporting their practices. Hence, involving users at some point in the project was not unusual because, as one senior consultant, Bruno, expressed,
The way people use the product is the truth people will always use your product or service differently than what you design, and therefore, as a designer, you cannot expect that even the ﬁnal prototype or even the product is the “ﬁnal idea.”

For example, one of the consultants working on a travel experience project for an airline recalled how an idea for seating arrangements, which was originally liked by all team members as making the best use of the limited space in the plane, was eventually rejected. Indeed, when it was prototyped with passengers, it was unanimously disliked for making them feel awkward and uncomfortable. For Bruno, this illustrated the importance of prototyping and testing ideas with users.

To summarize, in spite of their very diverse backgrounds, Delta’s consultants expressed commitment to Delta’s epistemic stance: developing new ideas required a deep understanding of users’ needs, practices, and sociomaterial context through empathy and an exploration of multiple solutions before settling on one. Delta’s epistemic stance (summarized in Table 4) included beliefs about the nature of reality and pursuit of knowledge that aimed to fulﬁll people’s unmet needs and practices, as well as a particular mode of investigating a problem, style of reasoning, and criteria for evaluating a potential solution. Gamma’s and Delta’s encounters with crowdsourcing for innovation. Gamma and Delta encountered the concept of crowdsourcing for innovation as several prominent organizations (e.g., Procter and Gamble, NASA) started using web-based platforms to make open, public calls to anyone outside their organizations to contribute expertise and ideas to internal innovation challenges. Gamma originally encountered accounts of this new practice in the form of a broadcast search, a popular method in the technical R&D space. After interpreting and evaluating such accounts, it concluded that crowdsourcing for innovation was not a very promising practice for pursuing novel insights. Delta, on the other hand, did not focus on emulating existing crowdsourcing platforms and, instead, started exploring and redeﬁning what crowdsourcing for innovation might be. As a result, in 2010, it launched an “open innovation” platform, DeltaCommunity (pseudonym). In what follows, we show how Delta’s and Gamma’s different framings, constructions of, and responses toward, the crowdsourcing possibility exhibited strong commitment to their distinctive epistemic stances. Gamma’s encounter with crowdsourcing. By mid-2008, Gamma started noticing that its marketplace was changing, because new consultancies using crowdsourcing platforms emerged in the R&D space and because Gamma’s clients started talking about these platforms and turning to them for solutions. Gamma’s senior managers began discussing the usefulness of crowdsourcing with industry leaders and academics and read industry reports describing and comparing different types of open intermediaries. The most prominent on their “radar screens” were “broadcast search” platforms, such as InnoCentive.com and NineSigma.com, which allowed anybody to compete in innovation challenges posted on the Web in the form of an open call (Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010). Other models included platforms allowing clients to scan proprietary technology that was not fully utilized by owners of intellectual property (IP) for possible licensing (e.g., Yet2.com). Many of these platforms were targeted at addressing complex technical and scientiﬁc problems similar to those that Gamma was asked to solve by its clients (e.g., inventing a new method for predicting solar particle storms).

To further investigate this new organizational practice of crowdsourcing, Gamma’s senior managers met with representatives of ﬁrms that had created and owned crowdsourcing platforms to explore possible collaboration opportunities. In addition, they were also learning about clients’ experiences with these new platforms. Having explored these new IT-enabled forms of organizing for some time, Gamma’s senior managers started labeling crowdsourcing as “a search for possible existing solutions via Internet brokers to ﬁll a perceived gap in [a] ﬁrm’s product offering, IP, or technology capability.” Initially, these senior managers acknowledged that, like Gamma’s own approach, crowdsourcing aimed at leveraging diversity of expertise and search for existing solutions rather than sticking to an existing and restricted expertise base or inventing solutions from scratch. However, on deeper examination, one of the senior managers pointed out that crowdsourcing was limited in its “ability to effectively navigate and leverage [the] external environment.” This was due to the inability of crowdsourcing intermediaries to translate innovation challenges into a common “functional language”—a mandatory step for Gamma’s “innovation algorithm.” The lack of functional translation had two negative consequences for generating novel insights. First, it meant forgoing insights that could be gained from “proper” problem reformulation, because crowd sourced problems needed to be formulated in a language that could be understood by multiple and diverse contributors. Second, it led to inefﬁciency, because one had to randomly search “the whole world” rather than focus on areas for which there was some tangible evidence for “functional relevance”—something that only scientists trained in Gamma’s methodology could achieve. Gamma’s senior managers were increasingly convinced that crowdsourcing was an “undisciplined” approach and thus much riskier and inferior to Gamma’s sophisticated methodology. A senior executive articulated Gamma’s position in a public forum:
It cannot work! It is too risky The fundamental question remains: are we [Gamma and crowds] speaking the same [technical] language or do we have a Babylon tower? How do you marry the fact that you bring in knowledge from remote areas, and you do not have knowledge to assess and adapt the knowledge you brought in? Are you looking for what you need to be looking for or just for what is on the surface? What questions do you give to these [crowds]? Who is responsible for reformulating the question?

This assertive view reﬂected Gamma’s commitment to its epistemic stance, which emphasized the need for reformulation of problems in a “universal,” functional language. For Gamma, developing new ideas required a speciﬁc style of reasoning that entailed a deep expertise

Examples of supporting evidence from interviews and ﬁeld notes Delta take on projects in various ﬁelds: from packaging and toothbrushes to new ﬁnancial, insurance, or educational services, and customer experience in airlines, train transportation, or healthcare. • Delta consultants stressed how it was important to observe and interview not only the “standard” users but also extreme users (who either had a lot of experience or no experience at all) to understand the whole spectrum of reality and uses. This is also why teamwork and multidisciplinary perspective was crucial. • “The trick is to look for areas which are similar and to look deeply at how they work and then to ask the question ‘what can we learn from this?’ For example, when redesigning how a large corporate HR department should relocate employees in a more human-centric way, we interviewed a wedding planner. Why was that relevant, you might ask? Well, there’s multiple stakeholders’ interests to balance, it’s a time-based, long, drawn-out process that involves multiple locations and suppliers, and it’s a highly emotional journey where expectations often have to be managed carefully.” (A Delta consultant talking about how analogies can help inspiration.) • “So the ﬁrst phase of work was a great bit of original research, human factors research, not just understanding the ﬂight experience of which there are a lot of challenges but also what it means to be from their country or what it means to represent this country. We spent quite a bit of time emerging into their culture, understanding the origins of where they come from everything that sort of informs who [they were] and what they are proud about.” (A Delta consultant.) • “You know we said that’s certainly an interesting brief and there are some opportunities there, but if you step back and take a look, you know the experience of ﬂight begins much earlier, far before you actually enter the plane. You know your experience in traveling is typically set usually in a negative way by all the experiences you have getting to the airport, checking in and purchasing your ﬂight, getting through security, and waiting in line. By the time you get to the airplane, you are already at a deﬁcit of experience. So we told [our client] that if you really want to affect the entire experience, then you need to think much more broadly about that journey beyond just that experience inside the tube.” (One of the project leads for the airline project reﬂecting on the original brief provided by their client.) • A Delta consultant explained how he went to work with an non-governmental organization (NGO) in Africa developing a water-delivery business. After a week of research and light prototypes, they realized that what the team thought would be the preferred way of buying water (i.e., from a booth) was not the one people in the community felt comfortable with. Because they all had cell phones, they felt comfortable with the idea of subscribing for water services. This was the ﬁnal business model they chose. This showed how Delta consultants were open to unexpected results and cross-pollinated across ﬁelds (water delivery and cell phone services, in this case).

Focused on developing innovative solutions that fulﬁll people’s needs and support their practices in various ﬁelds (product, service, experience, etc.) Onto• Reality is not given or stable but, rather, diverse and situated epistemological in time and space within a sociomaterial context. beliefs • The world is a source of inspiration for developing new ideas. • To develop a deep, meaningful understanding of the needs and behaviors, one needs to understand the users’ perspective and their context. • Final decision on the usefulness of the innovation comes from the users: if they use it or not; and how they use it. • The most promising path to generate knowledge is to start from “empathizing with users” and then to rely on phased collaboration (divergent, convergent thinking; multidisciplinary teams) and iterative prototyping.

Mode of investigating the problem area

• To investigate a problem, one needs to immerse in a user context, and develop a rich thick description of the context of use and the different actors involved using contextualized research (e.g., interviews, observations) aiming at developing empathy with the users’ point of view and uncovering unmet needs. • Evidence developed through research is organized in themes and patterns and contextualized through scenarios and personas that lead to the generation of a speciﬁc problem statement. • Critical attitude toward the problem as deﬁned by the client because of their own perspective (which often differs from the users’). • To solve a problem one needs to reframe it with an empathetic perspective with the end users (scenarios, personas, storyboards, and photos are key in providing this perspective) and reformulate it as a broad, open-ended question (e.g., “how might we ?”). • Intuitive reasoning aiming at generating new scenarios based on current tensions and unmet needs. (Key role of imagination and analogy.) • Divergent—convergent: One always starts with an open-ended perspective (research, then ideation and prototyping) and then converges on a few ideas that will be evaluated and tested (often through prototyping). • One ought to be open to “surprise,” the unexpected and the contradictory: that’s what will provide inspiration for a new idea. • Cross-pollination across various disciplines and contexts to get a richer understanding and a better chance to come up with a novel solution. • Research insights are considered “valid” if they can provide inspiration and generate “what if ” types of propositions. • An idea has to be meaningful for speciﬁc users (human-centered). • One needs to show, not tell an idea and develop multiple prototypes to test the idea with the users. • The main test for an idea’s usefulness is how users will react to it: reject or accept, and if they accept it, how they will use it. (Rejection and failure are part of a learning process.)

Style of reasoning: patterns of inference used to obtain relevant results

Mode of evaluating solutions

• All Delta consultants stressed the importance of visuals and prototypes. “If an image is worth a 1,000 words, then a prototype is worth a 1,000 images,” said one of the consultants. • Prototypes that do not work are as useful as those that do work explained several of our informants, because you can learn from them. One of our informants told us about “sacrifatory prototypes,” which are prototypes that they know will not work but they want to see how people would react to them, to understand better their emotions and perceptions.

in such language and “algorithmic” methods. Hence, Gamma’s senior managers appeared skeptical about how participants on a crowdsourcing platform could actually innovate in light of their lack of such expertise. Moreover, when crowdsourcing for innovation was conﬂated with the term “open innovation,” Gamma removed the latter term from its promotional materials so as to avoid a wrong association. Publically expressing disappointment with the potential of crowdsourcing, a senior leader explained,
Unfortunately “Open Innovation” has become synonymous with crowdsourcing. While we believe crowdsourcing has its place on the spectrum of Open Innovation methods, it is a system which relies on the probability that the right technology exists, and the right person will respond to the challenge. It neither ensures the right problems are being addressed, nor does it ﬁlter out the bad ideas.

In response to public praise of the breadth of knowledge accessed through the crowdsourcing for innovation models, Gamma’s senior managers felt compelled to counter-argue that their company was already able to harness diverse expertise through its global expertise network and patent search tools. They conﬁdently claimed that access to diversity was already done in a “disciplined” way, covering a “comprehensive set” of applied science and engineering disciplines, and with more predictable outcomes. When external experts were used by Gamma, it was trained innovation consultants who found and contacted such experts purposefully for a speciﬁc expertise. Both internal and external consultants could learn about the context of a client’s problem under the protection of conﬁdentiality agreements. By contrast, Gamma’s managers argued, in the context of crowdsourcing, it was the external experts already present on the platform—a diverse but still incomplete set—who provided insights without having learned enough about the context of a problem. Following Gamma’s controlled and “algorithm”-mediated path for investigating a problem eliminated “guesswork”—an apparent necessity when relying on open-call forms of crowdsourcing expertise. This comparative analysis was summarized in public presentations given to prospective clients under the title “Why Is [Gamma’s] Approach Better Than Other Known Expert Networks (InnoCentive.com, Yet2.com, etc.)?” In conclusion, Gamma’s senior managers explored, framed, and evaluated the potential of the new practice of crowdsourcing for innovation, which was largely equated with the broadcast search account of this practice, on the basis of their epistemic stance. Table 5 summarizes how Gamma’s commitment to a certain epistemic stance was generative of a particular construction of crowdsourcing. At ﬁrst glance, these broadcast search accounts appeared well aligned with Gamma’s epistemic stance, which also embraced the need for

accessing expertise in distant, seemingly unrelated ﬁelds. Yet, on deeper examination, Gamma’s senior managers constructed crowdsourcing as an inferior system of organizing for innovation. Delta’s encounter with crowdsourcing. At the beginning of 2008, Howard, a young consultant at Delta, started investigating how new technology might disrupt Delta’s innovation approach and working arrangements. In particular, he was intrigued by the emergence of novel practices made possible by social media. He started discussing with two of his colleagues the possibilities technology could offer to organize innovation work differently at Delta. The three of them (who would later become the DeltaCommunity cofounders team) were aware of some of the more traditional, competition-based and prize-based platforms (e.g., InnoCentive.com, TopCoder.com), but felt that these platforms were suitable for a very speciﬁc set of questions and reﬂected the assumption that scientists have strong extrinsic motivations with little need for collaboration. From the very beginning, the three consultants opposed the most popular accounts of crowdsourcing, i.e., ideas contests, because of the individualistic nature of these contests and the strong extrinsic motivations they involved. They also rejected the automated and decontextualized nature of broadcast search, which, for them, was very much at odds with Delta’s emergent, ﬂuid, and deeply contextualized mode of investigating a problem and creating solutions. They thus preferred to not use the term “crowdsourcing,” which, for them, implied treating participants as “crowds” of creative, yet unpaid, individuals rather than as a community of collaborative innovators. Instead of seeing these existing platforms as the only options for implementing crowdsourcing, and consistently with the critical attitude central to their stance, they took a divergent approach and wondered whether it would be possible to use technology to support a more “open” innovation process. In line with their style of reasoning, they reframed the possibility offered by crowdsourcing for innovation as broad open-ended questions: How might we reach out to a diverse number of people and invite them to share their views to develop a rich and empathetic understanding of a problem? How might we engage them in collaboratively developing solutions to complex social issues? They saw a possibility of leveraging—through a web-based platform—the energy and excitement of a highly diverse global community that could bring numerous contextualized insights on users’ needs and practices, as well as existing solutions, and develop them into concrete innovation outcomes to address complex social challenges. The DeltaCommunity founding team thought that developing such a global online community provided them with an opportunity to increase the number of diverse perspectives—which

How Commitment to a Stance Shaped Organizational Encounters with Crowdsourcing Gamma —Gamma considered only versions of crowdsourcing that dealt with technical R&D, avoiding broadening its attention to other alternative models, such as those used in open source software, Wikipedia, online communities. —Crowdsourcing compromised the process of understanding a client’s problem in its speciﬁc context and using “functional” language to search for breadth and depth of expertise in distant domains. —Lack of incentives and conﬁdentiality in public crowdsourcing forums meant that crowd participants were limited in their ability to understand clients’ problem in depth. —Open calls (vs. targeted invitation) to make expertise available did not guarantee that the right expert was in the crowd and would respond. Delta —Delta’s focus on human users did not restrict their imagination to a limited set of R&D platforms: A wide range of community-based and co-creation models such as Wikipedia were seen as relevant. —A focus on social innovation for the DeltaCommunity platform could inspire a wide community of passionate members. —Alight prototype on Facebook allowed Delta to explore interests of potential users. —DeltaCommunity became a global and diverse community that provided access to multiple views and thus rich understanding of the context. —The conversations on a challenge guided by the divergent-convergent phasing of the design process allowed for creative collaboration and innovative solutions.

was at the heart of Delta’s approach to developing rich insights and novel ideas—by tapping into the community’s diverse social, cultural, and professional backgrounds. In the spirit of prototyping—central to Delta’s innovation approach—the three consultants started to run “a really easy, agile experiment” (as Howard described it) by creating and posting a series of small challenges related to social innovation on a popular social media platform. Howard stressed the value of prototyping to test and explore ideas. In this case,
It was an opportunity to ask questions like, are we actually attracting people around speciﬁc challenges or are we attracting interested people that can contribute to diverse challenges?

Through this quick prototyping exercise, they evaluated the potential of the idea: they realized that there

was an interest in social innovation challenges among a diverse community and thus started exploring how to design a platform to support this interest. They then went through several prototyping phases, from foam-core to software prototypes, before eventually building the platform, DeltaCommunity. These multiple prototypes were key not only in learning what worked and what did not work but also in creating buy-in from senior managers. The prototyping spirit at the core of Delta’s innovation approach was expressed in DeltaCommunity’s motto, “always in Beta,” which was faithfully enacted in continuous reﬁnements of the platform, informed by users’ feedback and observations of users’ behaviors. Delta’s experimentation with crowdsourcing, through the construction of the DeltaCommunity platform, started as a curious exploration of the possibilities it offered to reﬂect Delta’s epistemic stance. As Howard

recalled, experimenting with crowdsourcing was a form of reﬂective exercise on Delta’s innovation DNA (its epistemic stance on innovation) and an attempt to recreate it in an online context with a great number of participants:

Downloaded from informs.org by [130.89.97.167] on 17 February 2017, at 08:09 . For personal use only, all rights reserved.

It was about actually understanding Delta’s DNA and dialing that up in our system because actually we wanted to create a system that resonated with Delta’s sort of make-up.

Indeed, social innovation challenges posted on DeltaCommunity involve going through a number of stages resembling those of Delta’s innovation process—that is, doing research to understand the context and users’ needs, redeﬁning the problem, brainstorming, and prototyping by following a divergent-convergent approach. For each challenge on DeltaCommunity, participants are provided with a brief and a lot of contextual information on the issue at stake, as well as asked to go and interview people in their communities to generate insights relevant to the challenge so that the ideas they develop in the next phase are centered on the users of the challenge. For instance, on one challenge, participants of the DeltaCommunity community were provided with a set of questions to interview people in their urban habitats, to document and try to be empathetic about what people did when they felt safe or unsafe. Participants were also encouraged to take photographs of a situation or place that made residents in urban areas feel safe and to share these with other community members on the platform. Thus, although DeltaCommunity was a signiﬁcant departure from Delta’s practices and form of organizing (i.e., going from small multidisciplinary teams of experts to an open online community with limited or no ﬁeldwork), it, in fact, faithfully reﬂected Delta’s commitments to a speciﬁc epistemic stance. At the time of the launch, the CEO also clearly stated that DeltaCommunity was a “learning experiment” and described Delta’s initial hypothesis as follows:
If we break the [DELTA] innovation process up, allow people to participate in different parts of the process, will we get engagement and we will get interesting output?

which only a few Delta consultants outside of the DeltaCommunity team participated; it was not yet used on Delta’s “regular” consulting projects. It seems that, although DeltaCommunity was consistent with Delta’s epistemic stance, a full-scale implementation might have severely disrupted Delta’s routines. Furthermore, Delta’s senior management team was striving to remain committed to the “prototyping spirit” central to their stance by allowing Delta’s consultants (“users”) to determine how useful DeltaCommunity could become in their work context. To summarize, commitment to Delta’s stance was manifested not only in how the Delta senior team justiﬁed discursively the value of crowdsourcing for innovation as a learning experiment but also in the way the DeltaCommunity founders imagined a new form of crowdsourcing and developed a platform that invited a community to innovate in line with Delta’s iterative and user-centered approach to innovation. Table 5 summarizes how Delta’s commitment to a certain epistemic stance was generative of a remarkably novel construction of crowdsourcing.

Discussion

In essence, Delta’s team was inspired by crowdsourcing, but not as a preexisting technological solution and/or some public accounts such as broadcast search; in fact, one of the cofounders claimed that the technology was “to a certain extent, anecdotal.” Instead, crowdsourcing was reimagined and constructed as an opportunity to learn more about, and experiment with, new practices supporting the production of new insights and enabling access to more diverse perspectives. It should be clariﬁed that Delta adopted crowdsourcing for innovation in a particular format. DeltaCommunity was a stand-alone “experiment” in

Our research ﬁndings suggest that, when Gamma and Delta encountered the possibility of crowdsourcing for innovation—a new IT-enabled practice for pursuing novel insights—they approached, framed, and evaluated the possibility by enacting their epistemic stance. Gamma framed crowdsourcing as an open call for anybody to tackle prespeciﬁed innovation problems and, after thorough examination, concluded that this new practice was more risky and less efﬁcient than relying on experts trained in reformulating problems and using “algorithmic” methods to yield novel insights. On the other hand, Delta approached crowdsourcing as a new practice offering access to a diversity of views with the potential to bring novel insights on social innovation challenges. To investigate further, Delta developed a working hypothesis—“What if we tried to innovate with an online community on social issues?”—and developed an online platform that would allow them to investigate and experiment with that hypothesis. Findings from our research thus suggest that Gamma and Delta imagined and weighed the likely epistemic implications of a new IT-enabled organizational practice for generating knowledge differently while remaining committed to their epistemic stance. Clearly, the two organizations engaged in very different sets of actions in part because of the different contexts in which each ﬁrm found itself. Because early popular accounts of crowdsourcing for innovation targeted scientiﬁc R&D, Gamma was increasingly faced with questions from its clients and prompted to take a position on this issue. Delta, on the other hand,

318

Information Systems Research 27(2), pp. 302–323, © 2016 INFORMS

faced few or no pressures during the same time frame. Notwithstanding such differences, once the two ﬁrms considered crowdsourcing, they both strove to remain committed to their epistemic stance because the new practice appeared to both of them as a new epistemic possibility. Key members of the two ﬁrms expressed this commitment through various emotional and spontaneous reactions such as the insistence on using or avoiding speciﬁc ways of investigating and thinking about problems. Our analysis does not imply, however, that Gamma’s and Delta’s commitment to their stances determined their eventual decisions to adopt crowdsourcing or not. In fact, one could imagine that each organization could have produced a variety of potential alternative responses while still maintaining commitment to its respective epistemic stance. For example, Gamma might have experimented with crowdsourcing by making open calls for speciﬁc expertise through a web-based platform instead of relying on its proprietary global expertise network. Drawing on our in-depth analysis and comparison of the two cases, we propose some broader theoretical insights. We argue that, when organizations—in particular organizations actively pursuing new knowledge— explore opportunities to adopt new IT-enabled practices for creating knowledge, they are likely to remain committed to their epistemic stance. Such exploration may happen through generating epistemic propositions about these new practices: Is it possible to create knowledge in this new way? Could we align the new practices with what we believe about knowledge creation? In constructing and exploring these questions, organizations are likely to remain committed to their stance to (re)frame and evaluate core characteristics of the new practice as deﬁned by public accounts, and—if actively experimenting—potentially transform such characteristics, as was the case with Delta. Findings from our research suggest that encounters with a new practice might not be determined a priori by considering alignment between the espoused stance of a ﬁrm and the cultural characteristics of a new practice—what could be referred as “cultural ﬁt” (Ansari et al. 2010, Rogers 1995). Rather, commitment to an epistemic stance is likely to be generative of new meanings, framings, and constructions of a new practice, especially in the absence of ready-made interpretations or a well-developed organizing vision (Swanson and Ramiller 1997). It is through commitment to an epistemic stance that novel characteristics of a new practice are emergently constructed, become organizationally meaningful, and are more or less legitimated, depending on whether the epistemic potential is judged as high or low. That is, when encountering a new IT-enabled practice for pursuing knowledge, organizations are likely to develop new interpretations and construct new meaning about how the practice

relates to their epistemic stance and its various dimensions. For instance, Gamma and Delta constructed through their actions, and experimentations in the latter case, new interpretations about how crowdsourcing enabled investigation of a new domain or problem (see Table 5). For Gamma, crowdsourcing enabled a certain mode of investigation (e.g., looking for experts through open calls), which could not guarantee that relevant expertise would be solicited when needed; this new interpretation—how crowdsourcing affords investigation of a domain or problem—was made visible in their public justiﬁcation for rejecting crowdsourcing. On the other hand, for Delta, crowdsourcing potentially allowed fruitful investigation of social innovation problems through online conversations among members of a global innovation community; this novel interpretation—crowds reframed as an open innovation community—was materially instantiated in the way DeltaCommunity was designed and social innovation challenges organized. Such diverse constructions of the new practice were emergent outcomes, which were produced as Gamma and Delta strove to remain committed to their stance. Given its signiﬁcance for the proposed theory, it is important to clarify the role of commitment to a stance. At ﬁrst glance, it might seem likely that commitment to a stance at the organizational level would also entail commitment to existing work practices. On deeper examination, however, our study shows that commitment to an epistemic stance, which is observed when encountering, framing, and evaluating a new practice for knowledge creation, may be decoupled from a concern to align a new practice with existing practices. This is because epistemic stance “guides ways of dealing with one’s problems though without providing algorithms” (van Fraassen 2004, p. 174). In other words, a stance involves only general modes of approaching and dealing with epistemic issues in practice and, while entangled with everyday routines, does not prescribe a speciﬁc set of actions. Think, for example, of Gamma’s style of reasoning, which includes reformulating the original problem by relying on preexisting scientiﬁc knowledge and by trying to identify contradictions in the engineering system under investigation. Such style is quite broad and offers a lot of ﬂexibility as to how a Gamma team will speciﬁcally tackle a client’s problem, such as what techniques they will use and which scripts of action and research methods are relevant. In many instances, Gamma has chosen different steps and inferential devices (e.g., TRIZ, functional analysis) to think about a problem, while remaining committed to a particular “disciplined” and deductive style of reasoning. Our research also expands on studies looking at the role of organizational actors’ “epistemic cultures” (Knorr Cetina 1999) when encountering new digital

technologies (Pentland 1995, Wagner and Newell 2004, Dougherty and Dunne 2012). Although not its focus, our research suggests that Gamma and Delta can be understood as historically constructed cultural contexts for accomplishing innovation work, which perpetuate certain traditions and often unreﬂective habits (Hargadon and Sutton 1997, Hargadon and Bechky 2006). As noted by philosophers of science, “solely as a consequence of immersion in a local culture, one may ﬁnd oneself holding a particular stance” (Chakravartty 2011, p. 40). Thus, through socialization into a certain organizational culture, actors also learn to take up and accept as valid certain attitudes of investigation and styles of reasoning, and internalize certain ontoepistemological assumptions. Recall, for instance, how a Gamma manager invoked organizational norms to “force” a “deviant” consultant to enact the innovation “algorithm” properly. In that sense, these two organizations have formed distinct cultures where different epistemic stances—attitudes of dealing with speciﬁc epistemic issues, such as their clients’ open-ended innovation problems—have been gradually developed, reﬁned, and internalized. Furthermore, our research delineates the distinction between culture and stance. Both culture and stance are performatively enacted—culture and stance are things people do. The epistemic culture analytical lens emphasizes how the practices for systematic knowledge production have been historically, socially, and materially shaped and emerged from habitual practices. By contrast, the epistemic stance concept places analytic emphasis on the future-oriented ways by which organizational actors activate certain onto-epistemological beliefs and associated modes of investigation and reasoning to cope with a speciﬁc epistemic issue. Epistemic stances constitute attitudes, which are actively taken in pursuit of new knowledge and can be articulated when confronted with ambiguous epistemic possibilities and choices. In our cases, although Gamma’s and Delta’s cultures could not be fully articulated because of their tacit and historically situated nature, organizational actors were able to articulate their epistemic stance in constructing, and acting on a new possibility for generating knowledge. Moreover, although philosophers of science are not primarily concerned with the distinction between individual and collective enactment of a stance, our study explores what it means to enact an epistemic stance collectively. Findings from Gamma and Delta demonstrate that the enactment of an epistemic stance was a collective accomplishment. For example, in Gamma, an algorithmic stance was enacted through interactions of multiple Gamma consultants, who jointly developed abstract reformulations of clients’ engineering problems by using shared “functional language.” In Delta’s case, multiple consultants with diverse backgrounds and

experiences were collectively committed to reframing innovation challenges from a user’s perspective to develop novel insights (see Table 4). 6.1. Implications and Future Research Directions Our study responds to calls made by Swanson and Ramiller (2004) to examine the organization-level construction of new practices and move beyond individuallevel interpretative actions vis-à-vis new possibilities. In line with prior literature on frames (Davidson 2002, Kaplan 2008, Kaplan and Tripsas 2008), our research highlights the importance of situated framing and avoids deterministic understandings of cultural ﬁt/misﬁt. At the same time, it makes a key contribution to that literature by clarifying “how frames are formed” (Kaplan and Tripsas 2008), and specifying a key source of framing a new practice at the organizational level— commitment to an epistemic stance. Our study also contributes to the literature on organization-level “inertial forces,” such as existing routines, capabilities, managerial frames, and organizational identity (see Tripsas 2009), by showing how epistemic stance as a key component of an organization’s cultural universe might trigger inertial reactions to new opportunities as we observed in Gamma’s case. Beyond highlighting the possible inertial inﬂuence of an epistemic stance, however, our research also unpacks the generative nature of an organizational epistemic stance. Prior literature suggests that, because organizations strive to preserve core characteristics of their existing organizational “universe,” they are likely to reject new opportunities that are deemed incompatible with such characteristics. Yet, the Delta case suggests that commitment to an organization’s epistemic stance might trigger a process of adapting and constructing new opportunities in a way that initially perceived incompatibility is avoided. Furthermore, from an innovation diffusion and adoption perspective, our study focused on early stages of ﬁrm encounters with the crowdsourcing possibility before a focal community image (“organizing vision”) became well deﬁned or “fashionable” (Abrahamson 1991, Swanson and Ramiller 2004, Wang 2010). Future research might investigate whether “late adopters” encounter new practices for knowledge creation by remaining committed to their epistemic stances, or whether they might succumb to institutional pressures (Swanson and Ramiller 2004) and adopt, perhaps unreﬂectively, practices that are contradictory to their epistemic commitments. Our work suggests the need for future research on the ways ﬁrm adopters of new IT-enabled practices for creating knowledge, such as crowdsourcing or data analytics, might maintain their commitment to a stance over time or might evolve their stance through reﬂection and learning. For example, it would be useful to understand if ﬁrms like LEGO,

which have ﬁrst shunned away from crowdsourcing, but gradually embraced it (Schlagwein and BjørnAndersen 2014), have evolved their stance or found ways of constructing how this new practice helps them stay committed to their existing epistemic stance. In addition, it might also be worth investigating how competing ideologies in the institutional realm, that is, “beliefs held by actors underpinning a preferred social order” (Barrett et al. 2013, p. 203), interplay with diverse organizational epistemic stances, shaping the diffusion of a practice over time. The literature also suggests that a new organizational practice might be adopted with greater or lesser “ﬁdelity” to the encountered version of a practice (Ansari et al. 2010, Zbaracki 1998). As others have observed (Boland et al. 2007), our empirical ﬁndings indicate that “ﬁdelity” may be less observable, at least during an era of ferment. Delta and Gamma encountered diverse, rather ambiguous, and still evolving versions of the organizational practice of crowdsourcing for innovation. Our empirical study thus problematizes the idea that there is a uniform practice to be adopted more or less faithfully by different organizations. Future research needs to pay closer attention to the relation between organizations’ cultural universes and the multiple accounts of a new practice that organizations might encounter and create. Our study also has implications for the strategy literature on crowdsourcing for innovation (Afuah and Tucci 2012, Boudreau et al. 2011, Felin and Zenger 2014, Piezunka and Dahlander 2015, Terwiesch and Xu 2008). It suggests that a ﬁrm’s strategic decision to engage with crowdsourcing might not be a response to objectively deﬁned features of the environment, for instance, the nature of the problem, the interests of the crowd, or the nature of the knowledge sought (Felin and Zenger 2014, Afuah and Tucci 2012). Rather, a response may be an emergent outcome reﬂecting certain cultural aspects of organizational contexts, in particular, epistemic stance. According to our empirical ﬁndings, factors such as the nature of the problem and knowledge requirements (Afuah and Tucci 2012, Lakhani et al. 2013) are not deﬁned “exogenously,” but rather framed and interpreted “endogenously” because actors enact their commitment to an organizational epistemic stance. Answers to questions such as “what is a crowd?” and “how might our ﬁrm work together with crowds to innovate and for what purposes?” are not a “given” for all organizations, but are shaped by the epistemic stance taken vis-à-vis the new practice (see Table 5). Thus, our work adds an interpretive dimension to the strategic studies of crowdsourcing for innovation. We examined how organizational aspects are crucial in understanding ﬁrms’ encounters with crowdsourcing, and other researchers have already started investigating

how individual-level interpretations of this new practice may shape its framing, evaluation, and potential adaptation (Lifshitz-Assaf 2015). Although our study has focused on the organizational level, we suspect that organizational epistemic stances might be historically rooted in larger organizational and professional ﬁelds, such as, for example, the professional ﬁeld of engineering and technology management for Gamma and human-centered and industrial design for Delta. To further understand the notion of epistemic stance, researchers might also explore the origins of stances and investigate links between organizational epistemic stances and institutional logics of new knowledge production, which might be observed in broader institutions of science (Kilduff et al. 2011). Kilduff et al. (2011) propose that organizations pursuing knowledge might reﬂect a combination of such logics of action in their ways of organizing innovation. Moreover, organizational stances might also reﬂect the logics of knowledge production, with which key organizational actors, such as “founding teams” (Beckman 2006, Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven 1990) have been familiar. Finally, our study helps practitioners better understand how their organizations respond to new ITenabled practices such as engaging “crowds” in the innovation process or big data analytics (Agarwal and Dhar 2014). Our research suggests that practitioners may need to understand better epistemic stances, which are part and parcel of the everyday work in their organizations, and examine whether there is a dominant stance that might offer underlying or implicit reasons for favoring or resisting new IT-enabled opportunities. Reﬂecting on and collectively discussing any implicit commitment to an epistemic stance, or deﬁning what is collectively held as novel insights or effective methods to develop such insights, may help a ﬁrm construct useful images of the potential value of new forms of IT-enabled practices for generating knowledge. Moreover, such reﬂection, we believe, can prove valuable when ﬁrms set up “digital experiments,” which are decoupled from daily organizational routines to enable ambidexterity in organizations (Gregory et al. 2015, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). Reﬂections on epistemic stance(s) can both guide the design of such experiments and be used in legitimizing new opportunities for generating novel insights. 6.2. Boundary Conditions To enhance the applicability of the proposed theory, we clarify some key boundary conditions of our ﬁndings. First, our empirical study was conducted in two organizations that enacted strong epistemic stances partly due to the nature of their business and their strong organizational identity as innovation consultancies. In a sense, the two ﬁrms’ epistemic stances

appeared almost inseparable from their externally projected organizational identity. In their efforts to explain to external audiences (e.g., potential clients) “who they are,” the two organizations usually invoked and articulated their commitment to a speciﬁc way of working and innovating, what we called their epistemic stances. One would thus need to cautiously apply insights from our research to organizations that are not exclusively focused on innovation vis-à-vis their externally projected identities (Tripsas 2009), or that are more fragmented because of their size and diversity in their practices than Gamma and Delta are. Such organizations might not exhibit commitment to a uniﬁed stance when encountering possibilities to adopt a new practice, because different groups or epistemic subcultures might coexist therein (Bechky 2003, Carlile 2002, Dougherty and Dunne 2012) and different priorities, such as maintaining a certain image in a market (Tripsas 2009), might override objectives to examine the epistemic implications of a practice. Yet organizations that are focused on knowledge and the systematic pursuit of novel products and services (e.g., many software development companies) are likely to remain committed to an organizational epistemic stance when investigating a new practice for pursuing novelty. As shown in this research, commitment to a stance is likely to lead to new constructions of what a new practice is or can be used. No doubt, future research needs to investigate pluralistic organizational contexts where intraorganizational politics and potential conﬂicts around what commitment to a stance might mean are observed. Future research can also explore whether and how organizations might deviate from their stances deliberately because of, for instance, a political move by speciﬁc actors (Levina and Orlikowski 2009, Schultze and Boland 2000), or inadvertently through ongoing situated adjustments (Orlikowski 2000). A second boundary condition of our ﬁndings concerns the type of new practice we studied. Crowdsourcing for innovation constitutes a distinctive IT-enabled practice for pursuing novel insights. The dynamics observed in Gamma and Delta might not be replicated in relation to other new practices that, in contrast to our cases, involve dealing with novel and more advanced technology prompting deeper sense making and framing around an IT artifact itself. Yet we maintain that encounters with new IT-enabled practices for pursuing novel insights, such as the use of “data analytics” in strategic decision making (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2012), are likely to be shaped by organizational epistemic stances. This is because such practices may call into question important components of an epistemic stance, and, in general, promise to improve the generation of knowledge. For instance, using data science may clash with an intuitive style of reasoning, which might be a core component of an existing

organizational stance. Future research should further investigate the role of organizational commitment to an epistemic stance in settings where other types of IT-enabled practices for pursuing novel insights are encountered. 6.3. Conclusion Organizations are increasingly confronted with multiple opportunities and new IT-enabled practices for generating knowledge. In this paper, we investigated how the organizational cultural context might shape emergent framings and responses to such opportunities. Building on an in-depth interpretive study in two innovation consultancies, the paper proposes a new perspective to understand organizational explorations of new IT-enabled practices for pursuing novel insights. In particular, it explains how commitment to an organization’s epistemic stance toward the pursuit of novel insights is likely to shape emergent organizational constructions and evaluations of the potential of such new practices. Such commitment is likely to inﬂuence the generation of organizational responses to reject or adopt a new practice, and, in some cases, transform a practice and its characteristics. Acknowledgments
